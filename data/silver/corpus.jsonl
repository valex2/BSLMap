Enrichment analyses identified biologic pathways associated with recovery factor scores. LC participants had lower recovery factor scores compared to recovered participants. Recovery factor scores predicted LC as early as hospital admission, irrespective of acute COVID-19 severity. Biologic characterization revealed increased inflammatory mediators, elevated signatures of heme metabolism, and decreased androgenic steroids as predictive and ongoing biomarkers of LC. Lower recovery factor scores were associated with reduced lymphocyte and increased myeloid cell frequencies. The observed signatures are consistent with persistent inflammation driving anemia and stress erythropoiesis as major biologic underpinnings of LC. The multi-omics recovery factor identifies patients at risk of LC early after SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals LC biomarkers and potential treatment targets. gov NCT04378777.

Among IDP, the incidence of initial breakthrough infection was 8.8 (95% CI 4.5 to 62.5) times higher during than before the Omicron era. There were 88 initial breakthrough infections among IDP (incidence rate 23.7/100 person-years) and 28 among HV (27.3/100) throughout the study period.

Research regarding the association of antibody production with neutralization potential is also limited. We conducted this analysis within the RESPIRA population-based cohort in Costa Rica to investigate relationships between antibody levels and neutralization potential at increasing exposure levels. We examined immunological profiles from systematically defined single-exposure groups (one vaccine dose or one natural infection), double-exposure groups (two vaccine doses or one vaccine dose following a natural infection), and a triple-exposure group (two vaccine doses following a natural infection). We used a S1-RBD-based serological assay for antibody level detection and a pseudovirion assay for neutralization potential quantification. Using linear regression, we compared antibody levels and pseudoneutralization geometric mean titers between exposure groups. For single exposure groups, one vaccine dose was inferior to natural infection, but a second vaccine dose was superior to natural infection. For double exposure groups, those who were vaccinated once after infection developed higher levels of antibodies and higher neutralization potential compared with those who had only two vaccine doses. We note that peak antibody levels following an exposure may plateau after two exposures while neutralization potential continues to increase with a third exposure dose. Response patterns were comparable in males and females and in sensitivity analyses stratified by age, vaccine type, and pandemic wave.

Here, we leveraged these tools to develop a generalizable method for designing novel self-assembling proteins starting from AlphaFold2 predictions of oligomeric protein building blocks. We used the method to generate six new 60-subunit protein nanoparticles with icosahedral symmetry, and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of three of them revealed that they were designed with atomic-level accuracy. To transform one of these nanoparticles into a functional immunogen, we reoriented its termini through circular permutation, added a genetically encoded oligomannose-type glycan, and displayed a stabilized trimeric variant of the influenza hemagglutinin receptor binding domain through a rigid de novo linker. The resultant immunogen elicited potent receptor-blocking and neutralizing antibody responses in mice.

ACE2, a regulator of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2. ACEis and ARBs can modulate ACE2 expression, potentially exacerbating viral load. However, the risks of higher viral load could be mitigated by favorable anti-inflammatory responses associated with ACEi and ARB use, highlighting the complexity of their impact on viral replication and disease outcomes. This study investigates the effects of sustained Losartan monotherapy (ARB) and combination Losartan + Lisinopril (ARB + ACEi) on viral replication, inflammation, lung function, and clinical measures of disease severity in a murine model of severe COVID-19 involving humanized ACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain. Both ARB and ARB + ACEi treatments led to increased ACE2 expression in the lungs and higher viral load post-infection. Despite this, the ARB + ACEi combination improved clinical scores, reduced weight loss and inflammatory cytokine levels, and preserved lung function, though it did not improve survival. Overall, the results of these controlled experiments provide insight into the complex dynamics of ACEi and ARB use in COVID-19; while these drugs induce expression of the ACE2 receptor and increase viral load, they provide compensatory modulation of the inflammatory response that appears to diminish severity of the infection.", "metadata": {"pmid": "40868984", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "mesh_terms": []}}

We hypothesize that children's protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 may be due to more frequent respiratory viral infections, which prime their airway antiviral defenses. Using case-cohort and case-control analyses in the Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 cohort, we evaluated whether infection with common respiratory viruses protects against SARS-CoV-2 infections and investigated airway molecular mechanisms by which this protection is achieved. We tested 10,493 longitudinal nasal swabs from 1,156 participants for 21 respiratory pathogens. We performed RNA-sequencing on 147 swabs (N=144 participants) collected prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and 391 swabs (N=165 participants) during and before rhinovirus infection. Participants with rhinovirus infection in the previous 30 days were at 48% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR:0.52, p=0.034). Among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, recent rhinovirus infection was associated with 9.6-fold lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p=0.0031). Higher pre-infection expression of 57 genes was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load, including 24 antiviral defense genes; 22 of these were induced by rhinovirus infections. Relative to adults, children expressed higher levels of the antiviral gene signature (p=0.014) and were at 2.2-fold increased risk for rhinovirus infections.

As proof of principle for this approach, we conducted a longitudinal immunoepidemiological study in children in the USA, focusing on enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infection dynamics but also capturing surveillance of a broad array of other endemic respiratory pathogens. Serendipitously, our sampling spanned the lifting of widespread COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in 2022-23, following a unique period during which virus exposure markedly diminished. This prospective, multicentre, longitudinal, immunoepidemiological surveillance study enrolled children aged 10 years or younger and weighing at least 8 kg at three US university sites. Blood specimens collected from January to June, 2022 (visit 1; pre-enterovirus season), and from January to June, 2023 (visit 3; post-enterovirus season), were tested in a multiplex assay for antibody binding to EV-D68 (prespecified primary objective) and a panel of 15 other respiratory viruses (exploratory objectives), and for neutralising activity against EV-D68, enterovirus A71, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; for antibody binding assay validation). Respiratory mid-turbinate swabs collected from children with symptomatic illness who participated in symptom surveys during July-December, 2022 (visit 2; enterovirus season), underwent metagenomic sequencing for pathogen detection. Serological data for EV-D68 were incorporated into epidemiological models based on case data from national surveillance to predict future transmission dynamics. Of 488 eligible children approached, 174, with a median age of 3&#xb7;4 years (IQR 1&#xb7;9-6&#xb7;4), were enrolled and followed up longitudinally from January, 2022, to June, 2023. Three children withdrew before study completion and 51 were lost to follow-up between visits 1 and 3. 90 paired serological samples and 73 respiratory swabs were tested. Mean antibody binding and neutralisation titres against all viruses tested increased over the study period, most notably in younger children with lower initial titres. The highest exposure rates (seroconversion or antibody boosting) were seen with SARS-CoV-2 (51 [59%] of 87), EV-D68 (36 [41%] of 87), RSV (36 [41%] of 87), and influenza (35 [40%] of 87), whereas the pathogens most frequently detected by respiratory swab sequencing were EV-D68 (clade B3), rhinovirus A, and rhinovirus C (n=7 each). Incorporating EV-D68 serological data into epidemiological models resulted in an 82% reduction in the range of prediction errors and a 33% reduction in median prediction errors for longer-term EV-D68 circulation dynamics compared with national pathogen surveillance data alone. In this study, we captured immunological evidence of endemic virus re-emergence in children following lifting of pandemic NPIs, which revealed high rates of exposure to endemic respiratory pathogens in a large group of seronegative, predominantly younger, children. This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of immunoepidemiological surveillance to enable more precise and accurate modelling of pathogen circulation dynamics to predict and prepare for future waves of disease.

We hypothesized that multiple events need to occur before IAV RNA synthesis activates RIG-I and investigated whether RIG-I activation is stimulated by the noncanonical or aberrant transcription of mini viral RNAs (mvRNA), an RNA that is overexpressed in highly pathogenic IAV infections. We find that mvRNAs can cause noncanonical transcription termination through a truncated 5' polyadenylation signal or a 5' transient RNA structure that interrupts polyadenylation. The resulting capped complementary RNAs stimulate the release of an mvRNA and complement RIG-I activation in trans.

The decreased virus level in lungs was linked to early infiltrates of classical monocytes producing IL-8 with systemic neutrophils, Th2 cells, and Ki67+CD95+CD4+ T cells producing CCR7. At the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, BCG-treated animals had higher frequencies of lung infiltrating neutrophils and higher CD14+ cells expressing efferocytosis marker MERTK, responses correlating with decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung. At the same time point, plasma IL-18, TNF-&#x3b1;, TNFSF-10, and VEGFA levels were also higher in the BCG group and correlated with decreased virus replication.

Here, we combine five mutations within H5 HA that dramatically increase its melting temperature and promote stable closure of the HA trimer. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy revealed that the stabilizing mutations create several new hydrophobic interactions, while maintaining local HA structure. We found that vaccinating mice with stabilized H5 HA immunogens resulted in higher hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization titers than non-stabilized comparators. Epitope mapping of vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibody responses using negative stain electron microscopy and deep mutational scanning showed that site E on the side of the HA receptor binding domain was immunodominant across all groups; however, the stabilized immunogens shifted responses toward the receptor binding site (RBS), eliciting a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies.

Defining molecular and cellular factors for protection from severe disease and death has been a goal to better understand and to predict and mitigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and future coronaviruses. Despite well-known susceptibilities to respiratory viral infections, respiratory allergy and allergic asthma have not been identified as risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in most epidemiologic studies and may be protective.

The diagnosis of asthma (odd ratio = 1.27), elevated serum T2 cytokine levels (median fold change = 1.06), and a higher frequency of T H 2 cells (difference = +2%) were associated with less severe clinical disease during hospitalization. Distinct T2-related transcriptomic changes in nasal and blood samples were associated with reduced virus loads. This included the expression of T2-regulated genes implicated in T-/B-cell activation and apoptosis in nasal samples and the expression of T2-regulated genes implicated in myeloid differentiation and reactive oxygen species signaling in blood. Among these, several canonical T2-regulated genes that were increased in less severe disease were identified to have antiviral properties in large high-throughput screens.

However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.", "metadata": {"pmid": "40611900", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "mesh_terms": []}}

We present the development and implementation of an online DDI screener to assess interactions during the STRIVE ensitrelvir trial. The STRIVE Network is conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating ensitrelvir's efficacy and safety in hospitalized adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and lower respiratory tract involvement. DDI guidance was compiled into a database accessed via a web portal where a multidisciplinary team categorized medications as permitted, prohibited, or conditionally permitted. For prohibited medications, washout periods and start/restart criteria were provided with alternative medication suggestions. Sites could request new medications for addition. After 18 months, a survey was conducted to assess the tool's usefulness. Version 1 of the DDI screener launched in December 2022 with 615 medications, expanding to 1182 through 6 updates by version 7. In 11 cases, prohibited medications were revised to conditionally permit enrollment after dosage adjustments (antihypertensives, anti-infectives, and psychiatric medications). Anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, and emergency use medications posed the greatest challenges due to trial blinding. With 334 participants enrolled across 150 sites in 13 countries, 117192 screener searches were completed by May 2024. The most searched medication classes were antihypertensive, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants. Sites found the DDI screener most helpful during screening/enrollment and valued the washout guidance.

The model selected from alternative immune and metabolic relationships showed that the coupled effects of citrulline and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) affected the control of viral shedding with parameters that varied with diet. Bats on the suboptimal fat diet appeared to control shedding more successfully than bats on suboptimal sugar or optimal protein diets.

Nevertheless, subsequent studies have shown that Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike also can yield efficacious vaccines, and we previously demonstrated that chemical conjugation of RBD to a carrier protein, EcoCRM &#xae; , enhanced antibody responses and induced strong virus neutralization activity in mice. Methods : Here, we compared the immunogenicity of this conjugate to that of an approved mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech in rhesus macaques over a period of nine months. Results : AS01-adjuvanted RBD conjugate induced a similar or better antibody response, receptor binding inhibition, and virus neutralization activity against different variants of SARS-CoV-2, compared to mRNA. IgG subclass profiles induced by conjugate and mRNA vaccines were initially dominated by IgG1 and IgG3 then switched to IgG2 and IgG4 dominant profiles during the subsequent six-month period. Polyclonal immune sera from the conjugate and mRNA had similar antibody avidity at multiple time points.

Therefore, we evaluated the protective activity of 1C3 as a standalone therapeutic in macaques exposed to either EBOV or SUDV. Two doses of 1C3 monotherapy, administered 4 and 7 days post-exposure, did not protect SUDV-exposed macaques and partially protected EBOV-exposed macaques. Notably, in a macaque that succumbed to EBOV infection, we identified two mutually exclusive escape mutations that emerged immediately after the first dose and resulted in two amino acid changes at the 1C3 binding site. We also detected a subconsensus treatment-emergent mutation likely affecting the 1C3 binding site in all three deceased SUDV-exposed macaques. Our findings highlight combination treatment with 1C11 as critical for protection, particularly against SUDV, and in vivo activity of unpartnered 1C3 as susceptible to rapid EBOV and SUDV escape under therapeutic pressure.

We aimed to identify and validate parsimonious transcriptomic signatures that accurately predict fatal outcomes within 48 hours of hospitalization. We studied 894 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across 20 US hospitals and enrolled in the prospective Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and nasal swabs collected within 48 hours of admission. Host gene expression was assessed by RNA sequencing, nasal SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured by RT-qPCR, and mortality was assessed at 28 days. We first defined transcriptional signatures and biological features of fatal COVID-19, which we compared against mortality signatures from an independent cohort of patients with non-COVID-19 sepsis (n=122). Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression in 70% of the COVID-19 cohort, we trained parsimonious prognostic classifiers incorporating host gene expression, age, and viral load. The performance of single and three-gene classifiers was then determined in the remaining 30% of the cohort and subsequently externally validated in an independent, contemporary COVID-19 cohort (n=137) with vaccinated patients. Fatal COVID-19 was characterized by 4189 differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood, representing marked upregulation of neutrophil degranulation, erythrocyte gas exchange, and heme biosynthesis pathways, juxtaposed against downregulation of adaptive immune pathways. Only 7.6% of mortality-associated genes overlapped between COVID-19 and sepsis due to other causes. A COVID-specific three-gene peripheral blood classifier ( CD83, ATP1B2, DAAM2 ) combined with age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.94). A three-gene nasal classifier ( SLC5A5, CD200R1 , FCER1A ), in comparison, yielded an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.64-0.83). Notably the expression of OLAH alone, a gene recently implicated in severe viral infection pathogenesis, yielded an AUC of 0.86 (0.79-0.93). Both peripheral blood classifiers demonstrated comparable performance in vaccinated patients from an independent external validation cohort (AUCs 0.74-0.80). A three-gene peripheral blood signature, as well as OLAH alone, accurately predict COVID-19 mortality early in hospitalization, including in vaccinated patients.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the microbial composition of two ampules of a mixed bacterial influenza vaccine produced in 1916, which were labeled as containing killed Bacillus influenzae , Pneumococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes . Methods : DNA was extracted from two 1916-era vaccine ampules, and due to low DNA yields, whole genome amplification (WGA) was performed prior to construction of Illumina sequencing libraries. Deep sequencing was conducted, followed by bioinformatic analysis to identify bacterial DNA content. Consensus genomes were assembled for predominant species, and further analyzed for serotype, phylogeny, and antibiotic resistance genes. Results : The amount of recoverable DNA from these century-old vaccine ampules was limited. The sequencing results revealed minimal detectable S. pneumoniae DNA. The first ampule contained predominantly H. influenzae DNA, while the second vial primarily contained Enterococcus faecium DNA, in addition to S. pyogenes DNA. Consensus genomes for H. influenzae , S. pyogenes , and E. faecium were assembled and analyzed for serotype, phylogeny, and antibiotic resistance genes. Conclusions : This study presents the first genomic analysis of century-old bacterial pneumonia vaccine ampules from the 1918 influenza pandemic era.

Here, underlying molecular factors leading to differences in virulence via changes in filovirus entry, replication and immune evasion strategies are summarized and assessed. While the filovirus glycoprotein contributes towards virulence by facilitating entry into a wide variety of tissues, differences in virus-host interactions and replication efficacies lead to measurable variances of progeny virus production. Additionally, immune evasion strategies lead to alterations in replication efficacy thus changing who has the upper hand between the virus and the host. Understanding and unraveling the contributions of these molecular determinants on filovirus virulence provide insights into the processes causing the underlying pathogenesis.

A secondary analysis of serologic data from participants in the ACTIV-1 randomized clinical trial, which evaluated immunomodulators for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A subanalysis of the ACTIV-1 immune modulator trial was conducted. Samples collected at randomization were tested for N protein levels and anti-spike antibodies. Logistic regression and linear models were employed to examine the association between serological measures and clinical outcomes, including 28-day mortality as well as progression to high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Among the 496 participants with detectable serum N protein, the median was 1143&#x2009;ng/dL, and levels decreased from 2559&#x2009;ng/dL in participants randomized at 6&#x2009;days of symptom onset to 477.6&#x2009;ng/dL at 11&#x2009;days.

Understanding COVID-19 severity: the role of viral proteins and antibodies COVID-19 severity can vary widely, and predicting who will develop severe disease is crucial for effective treatment. This study looks at two key components of the virus: the N protein, which helps the virus replicate, and anti-spike antibodies, which help the body fight off the virus. We studied blood samples from participants in a clinical trial to see how levels of these two components related to disease severity and outcomes, such as the need for advanced respiratory support or death. The study found that higher levels of the N protein were associated with more severe disease and worse outcomes, including a higher risk of requiring advanced respiratory support and longer hospital stays. On the other hand, anti-spike antibodies, which are typically seen as protective, did not show a clear relationship with the severity of illness or outcomes in this study. These findings suggest that the N protein might be a useful indicator for predicting how severe a person's COVID-19 illness might become, which could help doctors better manage and treat the disease.

Single-cell analysis of COVID-19 lungs revealed coexpression of CD13 and MMP14 by various cell types, and higher CD13 expression compared with controls. Neutrophils with high CD13 mRNA were enriched for genes associated with immaturity, though CD13 protein expression was lower.

Our data have shown that the IC 50 value is about 42 nM for inhibiting Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in vitro. The preliminary in vivo mice model using mouse-adapted EBOV has also shown a certain efficacy for delayed mortality compared to the control animals. A GRFT pull-down experiment using viral particles demonstrates that GRFT can bind to N-glycans of EBOV. Thus, it can be concluded that GRFT, through binding to viral glycans, may block Ebola virus infection and has potential for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD).", "metadata": {"pmid": "40005201", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "mesh_terms": []}}

Currently, no vaccines or specific antiviral therapies are FDA-approved for treating arenavirus infections. One major challenge for the development of new therapeutic candidates against these highly pathogenic viruses is that they are BSL-3/4 pathogens that need to be handled in high biocontainment laboratories. In this work, a recombinant non-pathogenic New World arenavirus, Pichinde virus (rPICV), was used for the development of a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay in the BSL-2 laboratory for the screening and identification of small molecule inhibitors against arenaviruses. The rPICV is a replication-competent virus expressing the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the infected cells proportionally to the infection rate. rPICV infection was optimized for an automated HTS in 384-well format with robust Z' scores, high signal-to-background ratios, and low intrinsic variance. Screening an established library allowed for the identification of five top hit compounds, which included ribavirin, a known inhibitor of arenaviral RNA synthesis, showing good potency and selectivity in inhibiting rPICV replication. The antiviral activity of the top hit compounds was further validated against another recombinant arenavirus, the OW lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rLCMV) and against laboratory strains of LASV (Josiah) and JUNV (Romero). The use of rPICV in the HTS-based antiviral assay under BSL-2 condition has proven to be safe and suitable for the identification of broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitors against highly pathogenic arenaviruses.", "metadata": {"pmid": "39970958", "journal": "Antiviral research", "mesh_terms": []}}

Using the pig model of human influenza, both vaccines were found to be immunogenic and elicited humoral and cellular immune responses that reflected the differences in vaccine design. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated by challenging vaccinated or unvaccinated, control pigs with a swine-origin 1A.3.3.2 virus and monitoring these groups longitudinally. Nasal shedding of viral RNA was reduced in the vaccinated groups compared to controls, although a statistically significant reduction was only observed on certain days in WIV-vaccinated pigs. To better understand correlates of immune protection, expression of porcine Mx1, CCL2 and TNFa mRNA was assessed in tissues. Virus infection of unvaccinated pigs induced mRNA expression of porcine Mx1, an innate IAV inhibitor protein, in lung tissue. In contrast, elevated Mx1 mRNA levels were not observed in lung tissue from WIV-vaccinated and, to a lesser extent, nanoparticle vaccinated pigs.

We developed a quantitative flow virometry assay to measure the shape of viral particles under various infection conditions (such as multiplicity, replication inhibition and antibody treatment) while using different combinations of IAV strains and cell lines. We show that IAV rapidly tunes its shape distribution towards spheres under optimal conditions but favours filaments under attenuation.

Between June 1 and Dec 17, 2021, 1196 (53&#xb7;2%) of the 2247&#xa0;adolescent participants recruited in the PREVENT-19 trial enrolled in the SNIFF study. The primary analysis population included 471&#xa0;participants in the immediate NVX-CoV2373 group and 220&#xa0;in the delayed NVX-CoV2373 group. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 14&#xb7;9&#xa0;cases per 100 person-years (95% CI 7&#xb7;9-25&#xb7;5) in the immediate group and 54&#xb7;2&#xa0;cases per 100 person-years (33&#xb7;6-82&#xb7;9) in the delayed group; vaccine efficacy was 73&#xb7;5% (95% CI 47&#xb7;1-86&#xb7;7; p=0&#xb7;0002). Incidence of minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 10&#xb7;3&#xa0;cases per 100 person-years (95% CI 4&#xb7;7-19&#xb7;6) in the&#xa0;immediate group and 36&#xb7;1&#xa0;cases per 100 person-years (19&#xb7;8-60&#xb7;7) in the delayed group; vaccine efficacy was 72&#xb7;8% (95% CI 37&#xb7;1-88&#xb7;2; p=0&#xb7;0023). After the second crossover dose, incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was 14&#xb7;6&#xa0;cases per 100 person-years (95% CI 8&#xb7;6-23&#xb7;0) in the immediate group (receiving placebo at crossover) and 9&#xb7;1&#xa0;cases per 100&#xa0;person-years (3&#xb7;0-21&#xb7;3) in the delayed group, with a durability ratio of 160&#xb7;3 (95% CI 59&#xb7;5-431&#xb7;6; p=0&#xb7;35). Almost all infections after crossover were minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, with a durability ratio of 151&#xb7;4&#xa0;(55&#xb7;9-410&#xb7;4; p=0&#xb7;41). Among adolescents participating in the PREVENT-19 trial during the delta (B.1.617.2) variant wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of symptoms, indicating its potential to reduce the reservoir of infections that contribute to community transmission.

Short stature, growth delays, and neurodevelopmental delays are also reported. APDS type 1 (APDS1) is caused by a heterozygous pathogenic gain-of-function variant in PIK3CD , and APDS type 2 (APDS2) is caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function pathogenic variant in PIK3R1 . The key clinical differences between APDS1 and APDS2 include short stature, frequency of gastrointestinal infections, and characteristic dental findings, which are more prominent in APDS2. The clinical diagnosis of APDS can be established in a proband based on suggestive clinical findings, or the molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PIK3CD (for APDS1) or PIK3R1 (for APDS2) identified by molecular genetic testing. Targeted therapies: Leniolisib, a selective PI3K delta (PI3K&#x3b4;) inhibitor, has shown promise in clinical trials by directly targeting the overactive PI3K&#x3b4; signaling pathway, a hallmark of the condition, and is therefore recommended as a first-line treatment of significant lymphoproliferative disease, including lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Sirolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is recommended for individuals with lymphoproliferative disease or organomegaly when leniolisib is unavailable; it is also used off-label due to its immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is reserved for individuals with severe or treatment-refractory APDS, including progressive organ damage, recurrent refractory infections, or severe immune dysregulation unresponsive to pharmacologic therapy. Supportive care: Regular intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy to prevent recurrent bacterial infections and improve immune function; long-term prophylactic antibiotics can be considered to reduce the frequency of bacterial infections; individuals with recurrent herpes simplex or herpes zoster virus can receive prophylactic acyclovir or valganciclovir. Leniolisib or sirolimus targeted therapies for lymphoproliferation. Glucocorticoids for acute management of autoimmune complications; other immunosuppressive agents for chronic management of autoimmune manifestations. Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids for chronic lung disease; pulmonary hygiene and preventative pulmonary care to decrease risk of respiratory infections. Nutritional support and dietary modifications for gastrointestinal manifestations; anti-inflammatory medications including high-dose glucocorticoids for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (which may also improve gut function and enhance absorption of targeted therapies); consider assisted enteral/parenteral nutrition for severe cases. Developmental interventions and educational support to address developmental delays and cognitive impairments. Offer counseling to address psychosocial impacts. Surveillance: Annually assess infection risk (blood/sputum cultures for EBV, CMV, and HSV), immune function (immunoglobulin levels, CD4+, CD8+, B-cell subsets, response to vaccines), lymphoproliferative status (CBC, B-cell counts), autoimmunity (ANA screen, TSH, TPO), respiratory function (including pulmonary function tests), and gastrointestinal status (liver function tests); CT or MRI of the chest every three to five years; colonoscopy symptomatically as needed; liver ultrasound at baseline and every two to three years; psychiatric assessments as needed. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing for the APDS pathogenic variant identified in the proband is recommended for all at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Detailed clinical and laboratory evaluations to assess for possible clinical features related to APDS is recommended for family members found to have an APDS pathogenic variant. APDS is an autosomal dominant disorder. Approximately 80% of individuals diagnosed with APDS have an affected parent and 20% of individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo PIK3CD gain-of-function variant (for APDS1) or de novo PIK3R1 loss-of-function variant (for APDS2). Once the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible. Influenza virus pandemics and seasonal epidemics have claimed countless lives. Recurrent zoonotic spillovers of influenza viruses with pandemic potential underscore the need for effective countermeasures. In this study, we show that pre-exposure prophylaxis with broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) MEDI8852 is highly effective in protecting cynomolgus macaques from severe disease caused by aerosolized highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus infection. Protection was antibody dose-dependent yet independent of Fc-mediated effector functions at the dose tested. Macaques receiving MEDI8852 at 10 milligrams per kilogram or higher had negligible impairment of respiratory function after infection, whereas control animals were not protected from severe disease and fatality. Given the breadth of MEDI8852 and other bnAbs, we anticipate that protection from unforeseen pandemic influenza A viruses is achievable.", "metadata": {"pmid": "39899769", "journal": "", "mesh_terms": []}}

This central role for T cells makes them a desirable target for assessing the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we combined two high-throughput immune profiling methods to create a quantitative picture of the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2. First, at the individual level, we deeply characterized 3 acutely infected and 58 recovered COVID-19 subjects by experimentally mapping their CD8 T-cell response through antigen stimulation to 545 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I presented viral peptides. Then, at the population level, we performed T-cell repertoire sequencing on 1,815 samples (from 1,521 COVID-19 subjects) as well as 3,500 controls to identify shared \"public\" T-cell receptors (TCRs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection from both CD8 and CD4 T cells. Collectively, our data reveal that CD8 T-cell responses are often driven by a few immunodominant, HLA-restricted epitopes. As expected, the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 peaks about one to two weeks after infection and is detectable for at least several months after recovery. As an application of these data, we trained a classifier to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection based solely on TCR sequencing from blood samples, and observed, at 99.8% specificity, high early sensitivity soon after diagnosis (Day 3-7 = 85.1% [95% CI = 79.9-89.7]; Day 8-14 = 94.8% [90.7-98.4]) as well as lasting sensitivity after recovery (Day 29+/convalescent = 95.4% [92.1-98.3]).

D0 lymphopenia (1426/2579) and severe lymphopenia (636/2579) were associated with increased mortality (aHR 1.48; 1.08, 2.05, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016 and aHR 1.60; 1.20, 2.14, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) and decreased recovery (aRRR 0.90; 0.82, 0.99, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.033 and aRRR 0.78; 0.70, 0.87, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 respectively). Trial participants with persistent D5 lymphopenia had increased mortality, and increased secondary infections, and participants with persistent or new lymphopenia had impaired recovery, as compared to participants with no lymphopenia. Persistent and new lymphopenia were associated with older age, male sex; prior immunosuppression, heart failure, aspirin use, and normal body mass index; biomarkers of organ damage (renal and lung), and ineffective immune response (elevated IL-6 and viral nucleocapsid antigen levels). Similar results were observed with severe lymphopenia. Lymphopenia was predictive of severe COVID-19 outcomes, particularly when persistent or new during hospitalization. A better understanding of the underlying risk factors for lymphopenia will help illuminate disease pathogenesis and guide management strategies.", "metadata": {"pmid": "39810077", "journal": "BMC infectious diseases", "mesh_terms": []}}

Most notable is histatin-5 which is exclusively produced in salivary glands with uniquely potent antifungal activity against the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to replicate in salivary gland acinar cells eliciting local immune cell activation. In this study, we performed studies to investigate the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on salivary histatin-5 production and Candida colonization. Bulk RNA-sequencing of parotid salivary glands from COVID-19 autopsies demonstrated statistically significant decreased expression of histatin and amylase genes. In situ hybridization, coupled with immunofluorescence for co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 spike and histatin in salivary gland cells, showed that histatin was absent or minimally present in acinar cells with replicating viruses. To investigate the clinical implications of these findings, salivary histatin-5 levels and oral Candida burden in saliva samples from three independent cohorts of mild and severe COVID-19 patients and matched healthy controls were evaluated. Results revealed significantly reduced histatin-5 in SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, concomitant with enhanced prevalence of C. albicans. Analysis of prospectively recovered samples indicated that the decrease in histatin-5 is likely reversible in mild-moderate disease as concentrations tended to increase during the post-acute phase. Importantly, salivary cytokine profiling demonstrated correlations between activation of the Th17 inflammatory pathway, changes in histatin-5 concentrations, and subsequent clearance of C. albicans in a heavily colonized subject. The importance of salivary histatin-5 in controlling the proliferation of C. albicans was demonstrated using an ex vivo assay where C. albicans was able to proliferate in COVID-19 saliva with low histatin-5, but not with high histatin-5.

Mutations that disrupt polyadenylation enhance ccRNA synthesis and increase RIG-I-dependent innate immune activation.

As an evaluation of how some features of SARS-CoV-2, unique among sarbecoviruses, may have been acquired from related viruses, we conducted phylogenetic and recombination analyses to compare the frequency of recombination among coronavirids across vs within genera, subgenera, and species. Among known betacoronaviruses, we identified 199 (183 intraspecies, 16 interspecies, but no intersubgenera) recombination events. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the ancestry of interspecies events was limited and less prone to affect 5' regions of coronavirid genome open reading frame 1 (ORF1) than intraspecies events. On the contrary, interspecies events were significantly more prone to impact the 3' end (ORF6-ORF8 and the nucleocapsid protein [ N ] ORF), suggesting the existence of region-specific constraints on recombination. This work substantiated that recombination among betacoronaviruses is limited by the genome similarity between their parental viruses. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 likely acquired unique features through recombination with closely related circulating sarbecoviruses (most likely from the same species) that co-existed geographically. Understanding the evolutionary events that led to SARS-CoV-2 emergence, spillover, and spread is crucial to prevent, or at least be prepared for, the same type of occurrence in the future. Given that SARS-CoV-2 has some characteristics not found in other closely related viruses, we aimed to systematically assess how likely these unique features may have been acquired through recombination. We found that, although recombination is a frequent phenomenon among betacoronaviruses, it is mostly limited to closely related members of the same species.

Worldwide, septicemia is among the top 10 causes of lethality because of the shock and multiorgan dysfunction that arise from the host vascular response. In the monoclonal gammopathy-associated capillary leak syndrome (MG-CLS), even otherwise mundane infections induce recurrent septic-like episodes of profound microvascular hyperpermeability and shock. There are no defined genetic risk factors for MG-CLS or effective treatments for acute crises. We characterized predicted loss-of-function mutations in PARP15 (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 15), a protein of unknown function that is absent in mice, in patients with MG-CLS. We analyzed barrier function in PARP15-deficient vascular endothelial cells and vascular leakage in mice engineered to express wild-type or loss-of-function variant human PARP15. We discovered several loss-of-function PARP15 variants associated with MG-CLS. These mutations severely reduced PARP15 enzymatic function. The presence of the most frequently detected variant (G628R) correlated with clinical markers of severe vascular leakage. In human microvascular endothelial cells, PARP15 suppressed cytokine-induced barrier disruption by ADP-ribosylating the scaffold protein JIP3 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein 3) and inhibiting p38 MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase activation. Mice expressing enzymatically inactive human PARP15(G628R) were significantly more prone to inflammation-associated vascular leakage than mice expressing wild-type PARP15 in a p38-dependent fashion. PARP15 represents a previously unrecognized genetic susceptibility factor for MG-CLS. PARP15-mediated ADP ribosylation is an essential and genetically determined mechanism of the human vascular response to inflammation.", "metadata": {"pmid": "39479769", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "mesh_terms": []}}

In this work, serum antibodies to protein constructs from SCV2 and a representative bat coronavirus isolated in Cambodia (RshSTT182) are measured in pre-pandemic Cambodian human sera using ELISA assays.

The pathogenesis of neurological disease is complex and has not been able to be studied in current animal models as they are skewed towards the development of lethal respiratory disease rather than neurological disease. Although NiV neurological disease can be observed in animal models, there is currently no model where the majority of animals consistently develop neurological disease. Here, we developed a new Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) model to mimic neurological disease in humans. Hamsters were inoculated intracranially in the cerebellomedullary cistern with different doses of NiV, strain Malaysia. Intracranial NiV inoculation in the cerebellomedullary cistern resulted in a rapid progression towards severe neurological disease requiring euthanasia. High Nipah viral loads were detected in the brains, and NiV spread from the CNS to the lungs. Histopathologic examination of the brain showed ischemic necrosis, often accompanied by marked edema and hemorrhage. NiV antigen was detected primarily in meninges and cerebellum, but rarely observed in brain parenchyma. These histological lesions were different from the typical lesions observed in NiV-infected humans.

We aimed to provide insight into the epidemic by sequencing samples obtained from individuals with mpox in Republic of the Congo. In this cross-sectional, descriptive study, samples were collected from individuals with suspected mpox between Jan 15 and April 8, 2024, in Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, Likouala, Cuvette-Centrale, and Plateaux (Republic of the Congo).

To constrain viral escape through resistance mutations, we combined antibody variable regions that recognize different RBD sites into multispecific antibodies. Here, we describe multispecific antibodies, including a trivalent trispecific antibody that potently neutralized diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants and prevented virus escape more effectively than single antibodies or mixtures of the parental antibodies. Despite being generated before the appearance of Omicron, this trispecific antibody neutralized all major Omicron variants through BA.4/BA.5 at nanomolar concentrations. Negative stain electron microscopy suggested that synergistic neutralization was achieved by engaging different epitopes in specific orientations that facilitated binding across more than one spike protein. Moreover, a tetravalent trispecific antibody containing the same variable regions as the trivalent trispecific antibody also protected Syrian hamsters against Omicron variants BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 challenge, each of which uses different amino acid substitutions to mediate escape from therapeutic antibodies.

At month 19, GMTs were 31&#x2009;408&#xa0;EU/mL (23&#x2009;181-42&#x2009;554) for the booster group and 1406&#xa0;EU/mL (1078-1833) for the no-booster group; at month 36, GMTs were 10&#x2009;146&#xa0;EU/mL (7960-12&#x2009;933) for the booster group and 1240&#xa0;EU/mL (984-1563) for the no-booster group. Accordingly, the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of antibody titres had increased almost 21-fold more in the booster versus no-booster group at 1&#xa0;month after booster administration (GMR 20&#xb7;6; 95% CI 18&#xb7;2-23&#xb7;0; p&lt;0&#xb7;0001) and was still over 7-fold higher at month 36 (GMR 7&#xb7;8; 95% CI 5&#xb7;5-10&#xb7;2; p&lt;0&#xb7;0001). Consistent with previous reports of this vaccine's side-effects, transient mono-articular or oligo-articular arthritis was diagnosed in 18 (9%) of 207&#xa0;primary vaccination recipients; after randomisation, arthritis was diagnosed in one (2%)&#xa0;of 57&#xa0;participants in the no-booster group. No new cases of arthritis developed after booster administration. Four serious adverse events occurred following randomisation: one (epistaxis) in the booster group and three (gastrointestinal haemorrhage, prostate cancer, and tachyarrhythmia) in the no-booster group. None of the serious adverse events was judged attributable to the booster vaccination assignment. In addition to no new safety concerns and in marked contrast to earlier trials evaluating short-term boosting, delaying a rVSV&#x394;G-ZEBOV-GP booster until month 18&#xa0;resulted in an increase in GMT that remained several-fold above the no-booster group GMT for at least 18&#xa0;months. These findings could have implications for defining the optimal timing of booster doses as pre-exposure prophylaxis in populations at ongoing risk for Ebola virus exposure.

Here, we show that neutralization titers and breadth of matched human and hamster pre-Omicron variant primary infection sera correlate well and generate similar antigenic maps. The hamster antigenic map shows modest antigenic drift among XBB sub-lineage variants, with JN.1 and BA.4/BA.5 variants within the XBB cluster, but with fivefold to sixfold antigenic differences between these variants and XBB.1.5. Compared to sera following only ancestral or bivalent COVID-19 vaccinations, or with post-vaccination infections, XBB.1.5 booster sera had the broadest neutralization against XBB sub-lineage variants, although a fivefold titer difference was still observed between JN.1 and XBB.1.5 variants. These findings suggest that antibody coverage of antigenically divergent JN.1 could be improved with a matched vaccine antigen.IMPORTANCEUpdates to COVID-19 vaccine antigens depend on assessing how much vaccine antigens differ antigenically from newer SARS-CoV-2 variants. Human sera from single variant infections are ideal for discriminating antigenic differences among variants, but such primary infection sera are now rare due to high population immunity. It remains unclear whether sera from experimentally infected animals could substitute for human sera for antigenic assessments. This report shows that neutralization titers of variant-matched human and hamster primary infection sera correlate well and recognize variants similarly, indicating that hamster sera can be a proxy for human sera for antigenic assessments. We further show that human sera following an XBB.1.5 booster vaccine broadly neutralized XBB sub-lineage variants but titers were fivefold lower against the more recent JN.1 variant.

Mass spectrometry defined for the first time the global ADP-ribosylome during infection, creating an infection-specific profile with almost 4,300 modification sites on ~1,080 host proteins, as well as over 100 modification sites on viral proteins. Our data indicate that the global increase likely reflects a change in the form of ADP-ribosylation rather than modification of new targets. Functional assays demonstrated that modification of the viral replication machinery antagonizes its activity and further revealed that the anti-viral activity of PARPs and ADP-ribosylation is counteracted by the influenza A virus protein NS1, assigning a new activity to the primary viral antagonist of innate immunity. We identified PARP1 as the enzyme producing the majority of poly(ADP-ribose) present during infection.

However, in most cases, the consequences of those virus-host interactions for virus replication were not experimentally pursued, which is a necessary step in determining whether the interactions represent pro- or anti-viral events. One putative interaction commonly identified in multiple studies was between the host adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) subunit B1 (AP3B1) and the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E). AP3B1 is one subunit of AP-3 required for the biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles (LROs), and its function impacts important disease processes including inflammation and vascular health. Thus, interactions between AP3B1 and SARS-CoV-2 might influence the clinical outcomes of infection. To determine if AP3B1 has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, we first confirmed the interaction in virus-infected cells using immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). AP3B1 is required by multiple viruses to aid in the replication cycle and therefore may be a therapeutic target. However, we found that the overexpression of AP3B1 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas the siRNA-mediated depletion of AP3B1 increased the release of infectious virus, suggesting an antiviral role for AP3B1. Together, our findings suggest that AP3B1 is an intrinsic barrier to SARS-CoV-2 replication through interactions with the viral E protein.

Prospective assessment of humoral immune response, which was measured based on the SARS-CoV-2 antispike receptor binding domain IgG titer, was performed post vaccination at various time points, focusing on Sinopharm and Pfizer vaccines. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS and GraphPad Prism. COVID-19 VE remained consistently high before the emergence of the Omicron variant, with lower estimates during the Delta wave than those during the Alpha wave for primary vaccination schemes. However, vaccines continued to offer significant protection against infection. VE estimates consistently decreased for the Omicron variant across post-vaccination timeframes and schemes. VE against hospitalization declined over time and was influenced by the variant. No breakthrough infections progressed to critical or fatal COVID-19. Immunogenicity analysis revealed that the homologous Pfizer regimen elicited a stronger humoral response than Sinopharm, while a heterologous Sinopharm/Pfizer regimen yielded comparable results to the Pfizer regimen. Over time, both Sinopharm's and Pfizer's primary vaccination schemes exhibited decreased humoral immunity titers, with Pfizer being a more effective booster than Sinopharm. This study, focusing on healthy young adults, provides insights into VE during different pandemic waves. Continuous research and monitoring are essential for understanding vaccine-mediated immune responses under evolving circumstances.", "metadata": {"pmid": "39269963", "journal": "PloS one", "mesh_terms": []}}

Macaques experienced mild infection with USA-WA1/2020 and shed viral RNA in the respiratory tract and stool, including subgenomic RNA indicative of replication in the GI tract. Intestinal immune cell populations were disturbed, with significantly fewer proliferating (Ki67+) jejunal B cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques than uninfected ones. Modest translocation of bacteria/bacterial antigen was observed across the colonic epithelium, with a corresponding significant increase in plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) that may be induced by LPS. Human plasma demonstrated significant decreases in interleukin (IL)-6 and sCD14 upon recovery from COVID-19, suggesting resolution of inflammation and response to translocated bacteria. sCD14 significantly positively correlated with zonulin, an indicator of gut barrier integrity, and IL-6. These results demonstrate that GI perturbations such as microbial translocation can occur in even mild SARS-CoV-2 infections and may contribute to the COVID-19 inflammatory state.IMPORTANCEThis study investigates gastrointestinal (GI) barrier disruption in SARS-CoV-2 infections and how it may contribute to disease. We observed bacteria or bacterial products crossing from the colon interior (the lumen) to the lamina propria during SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. Bacteria/bacterial products are tolerated in the lumen but may induce immune responses if they translocate to the lamina propria. We also observed a significant increase in soluble CD14, which is associated with an immune response to bacterial products. In addition, we observed that humans recovering from COVID-19 experienced a significant decrease in soluble CD14, as well as the inflammatory marker interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 and sCD14 correlated significantly across macaque and human samples.

Participants were randomly assigned (per prespecified randomisation ratios within enrolment waves) according to a computer-generated randomisation scheme, stratified by age (&lt;65 years and &#x2265;65 years), to various intravenous or subcutaneous doses of casirivimab and imdevimab before, after, or at the same time as mRNA-1273 or to mRNA-1273 only. The doses of casirivimab and imdevimab were chosen to mimic various time intervals between receipt of 1200 mg of the mAb and the first dose of a primary series with mRNA-1273. The primary endpoint was vaccine-induced 50% inhibitory dilution neutralising antibody titres to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, 56 days after the first vaccination. Secondary endpoints included vaccine-induced total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Exploratory endpoints included blood-derived T-cell and B-cell responses. The per-protocol set was used for the analysis of the primary endpoint and included all randomly assigned participants who received both doses of the vaccine and completed the injection or infusion of casirivimab and imdevimab per protocol, had no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past or in the 56 days after the first dose of vaccine, and did not receive any intervention outside of the study that could alter the immune response. Safety was assessed in the safety analysis set, which included all randomly assigned participants who had received one or more doses of mRNA-1273 or any study drug, and analysed based on treatment received. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04852978, and is complete. Between April 29, 2021, and Nov 21, 2022, 807 participants were assessed for eligibility and 295 were randomly assigned. 293 participants were included in the safety analysis set and 260 were included in the per-protocol set. All vaccinated participants developed neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, with median titres above the published protective threshold (100 IU/mL) against the SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant (considered a reference strain at the time the initial COVID-19 vaccines were developed). Titres were decreased up to 4-fold (median titres 280-450 IU/mL for casirivimab and imdevimab vs 1160 IU/mL for vaccine only on day 56) when casirivimab and imdevimab was given 85 days or less before vaccination (150-1200 mg intravenously) or co-administered subcutaneously (600 mg or 1200 mg) with vaccination. Minimal reduction in neutralisation titres was observed in the 48 mg and 12 mg intravenous groups, corresponding to receipt of casirivimab and imdevimab 113 days and 169 days, respectively, before vaccination, and when administering the vaccine 6 days before the mAb. Across all groups, mAbs had a minimal effect on vaccine-induced total antibodies and T-cell responses to the spike protein. Casirivimab and imdevimab plus mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated; a slight increase in treatment-emergent adverse events was observed in the casirivimab and imdevimab plus vaccine groups versus the vaccine-only group. Casirivimab and imdevimab administration before or at the time of COVID-19 vaccination reduced the elicitation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies, but minimal effect was observed when vaccination occurred before mAb administration. Although the clinical significance of this decrease in neutralisation is unclear, this evidence suggests that further investigation of potential interactions could be warranted before concurrent clinical use of mAbs and vaccines targeting the same viral proteins as their main modes of action for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases.

The major viral matrix protein, VP40, is trafficked to the plasma membrane and promotes viral particle formation and subsequent viral egress. In the present study, we assessed the role of the small GTPase Rab11-mediated endocytic pathway in Marburg virus (MARV) particle formation and budding. Although Rab11 was predominantly localized in the perinuclear region, it exhibited a more diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm of cells transiently expressing MARV VP40. Rab11 was incorporated into MARV-like particles. Expression of the dominant-negative form of Rab11 and knockdown of Rab11 decreased the amount of VP40 fractions in the cell periphery. Moreover, downregulation of Rab11 moderately reduced the release of MARV-like particles and authentic MARV. We further demonstrated that VP40 induces the distribution of the microtubule network toward the cell periphery, which was partly associated with Rab11. Depolymerization of microtubules reduced the accumulation of VP40 in the cell periphery along with viral particle formation. VP40 physically interacted with &#x3b1;-tubulin, a major component of microtubules, but not with Rab11. Taken together, these results suggested that VP40 partly interacts with microtubules and facilitates their distribution toward the cell periphery, leading to the trafficking of transiently tethering Rab11-positive vesicles toward the cell surface. As we previously demonstrated the role of Rab11 in the formation of Ebola virus particles, the results here suggest that filoviruses in general exploit the vesicle-trafficking machinery for proper virus-particle formation and subsequent egress. These pathways may be a potential target for the development of pan-filovirus therapeutics.IMPORTANCEFiloviruses, including Marburg and Ebola viruses, produce distinct filamentous viral particles. Although it is well known that the major viral matrix protein of these viruses, VP40, is trafficked to the cell surface and promotes viral particle production, details regarding the associated molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the role of the small GTPase Rab11-mediated endocytic pathway in this process. Our findings revealed that Marburg virus exploits the Rab11-mediated vesicle-trafficking pathway for the release of virus-like particles and authentic virions in a microtubule network-dependent manner. Previous findings demonstrated that Rab11 is also involved in Ebola virus-particle production. Taken together, these data suggest that filoviruses, in general, may hijack the microtubule-dependent vesicle-trafficking machinery for productive replication.

In this study we aimed to address key knowledge gaps regarding MERS epidemiology among high-risk communities associated with such herds, which is essential information for effective control strategies. We did a cross-sectional study between Sept 27, 2017, and Oct 11, 2018, among members of livestock-owning households in southern Jordan (Aqaba East, Aqaba West, Ma'an East, and Ma'an West regions), with random selection of households (house and tent dwellings) from Ministry of Agriculture lists via computer-generated randomisation lists. Household visits were done, with questionnaires administered to household members regarding potential risk factors for MERS-CoV exposure in the past 6&#xa0;months and blood samples and nasal and oral swabs collected, alongside physical examination data including blood pressure and blood glucose. Children younger than 5&#xa0;years and individuals without capacity to provide informed consent were excluded. Serum was tested for IgG antibodies to MERS-CoV spike protein (S1 subunit) and nucleocapsid (N) protein with in-house indirect ELISAs, and viral RNA was detected in nasal and oral samples by RT-PCR. The primary outcome was evidence of MERS-CoV exposure (ascertained by seropositive status on S1 or N&#xa0;ELISAs, or a positive swab sample on RT-PCR); secondary outcomes were potential associations between possible risk factors and seropositive status. RT-PCR data were to be presented descriptively. Seroprevalence estimates were obtained at the individual and household levels, and associations between hypothetical risk factors and seropositive status were assessed with use of mixed-effects logistic regression.

Considering the ongoing need for new COVID-19 vaccines, it is crucial to modify our approach and incorporate more conserved regions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to effectively address emerging viral variants. The nucleocapsid protein is a structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 that is involved in replication and immune responses. Furthermore, this protein offers significant advantages owing to the minimal accumulation of mutations over time and the inclusion of key T-cell epitopes critical for SARS-CoV-2 immunity. A novel strategy that may be suitable for the new generation of vaccines against COVID-19 is to use a combination of antigens, including the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, to elicit robust humoral and potent cellular immune responses, along with long-lasting immunity. The strategic use of multiple antigens aims to enhance vaccine efficacy and broaden protection against viruses, including their variants. The immune response against the nucleocapsid protein from other coronavirus is long-lasting, and it can persist up to 11 years post-infection. Thus, the incorporation of nucleocapsids (N) into vaccine design adds an important dimension to vaccination efforts and holds promise for bolstering the ability to combat COVID-19 effectively. In this review, we summarize the preclinical studies that evaluated the use of the nucleocapsid protein as antigen.

One of the contributing factors to the high annual incidence of human influenza is the virus's ability to evade acquired immunity through continual antigenic evolution. Understanding the evolutionary forces that act within and between hosts is therefore critical to interpreting past trends in influenza virus evolution and in predicting future ones. Several studies have analyzed longitudinal patterns of influenza A virus genetic diversity in natural human infections to assess the relative contributions of selection and genetic drift on within-host evolution. However, in these natural infections, within-host viral populations harbor very few single-nucleotide variants, limiting our resolution in understanding the forces acting on these populations in vivo . Furthermore, low levels of within-host viral genetic diversity limit the ability to infer the extent of drift across transmission events. Here, we propose to use influenza virus genomic diversity as an alternative signal to better understand within- and between-host patterns of viral evolution. Specifically, we focus on the dynamics of defective viral genomes (DVGs), which harbor large internal deletions in one or more of influenza virus's eight gene segments. Our longitudinal analyses of DVGs show that influenza A virus populations are highly dynamic within hosts, corroborating previous findings based on viral genetic diversity that point toward the importance of genetic drift in driving within-host viral evolution. Furthermore, our analysis of DVG populations across transmission pairs indicates that DVGs rarely appeared to be shared, indicating the presence of tight transmission bottlenecks. Our analyses demonstrate that viral genomic diversity can be used to complement analyses based on viral genetic diversity to reveal processes that drive viral evolution within and between hosts.", "metadata": {"pmid": "38883977", "journal": "Virus evolution", "mesh_terms": []}}

Most notable is histatin-5 which is exclusively produced in salivary glands with uniquely potent antifungal activity against the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans . Recently, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to replicate in salivary gland acinar cells eliciting local immune cell activation. In this study, we performed mechanistic and clinical studies to investigate the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on salivary histatin-5 production and Candida colonization. Bulk RNA-sequencing of parotid salivary glands from COVID-19 autopsies demonstrated statistically significant decreased expression of histatin genes. In situ hybridization, coupled with immunofluorescence for co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 spike and histatin in salivary gland cells, showed that histatin was absent or minimally present in acinar cells with replicating viruses. To investigate the clinical implications of these findings, salivary histatin-5 levels and oral Candida burden in saliva samples from three independent cohorts of mild and severe COVID-19 patients and matched healthy controls were evaluated. Results revealed significantly reduced histatin-5 in SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, concomitant with enhanced prevalence of C. albicans . Analysis of prospectively recovered samples indicated that the decrease in histatin-5 is likely reversible in mild-moderate disease as concentrations tended to increase during the post-acute phase. Importantly, salivary cytokine profiling demonstrated correlations between activation of the Th17 inflammatory pathway, changes in histatin-5 concentrations, and subsequent clearance of C. albicans in a heavily colonized subject. The importance of salivary histatin-5 in controlling the proliferation of C. albicans was demonstrated using an ex vivo assay where C. albicans was able to proliferate in COVID-19 saliva with low histatin-5, but not with high histatin-5. Taken together, the findings from this study provide direct evidence implicating SARS-CoV-2 infection of salivary glands with compromised oral innate immunity, and potential predisposition to oral candidiasis.", "metadata": {"pmid": "38798323", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "mesh_terms": []}}

While vaccination and early anti-viral therapies are effective in preventing or limiting the pathogenic host response, this latter phase is poorly understood with no highly effective treatment options. Inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) increase levels of anti-inflammatory molecules called epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). This study aimed to investigate the impact of sEH inhibition on the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a mouse model with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression. Mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with either vehicle or the sEH inhibitor 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU). At day 5 post-infection, SARS-CoV-2 induced weight loss, clinical signs, a cytokine storm, an eicosanoid storm, and severe lung inflammation with ~50% mortality on days 6-8 post-infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced lung expression of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway genes, while suppressing expression of most cytochrome P450 genes. Treatment with the sEH inhibitor TPPU delayed weight loss but did not alter clinical signs, lung cytokine expression or overall survival of infected mice. Interestingly, TPPU treatment significantly reversed the eicosanoid storm and attenuated viral-induced elevation of 39 fatty acids and oxylipins from COX, LOX and P450 pathways, which suggests the effects at the level of PLA 2 activation. The suppression of the eicosanoid storm by TPPU without corresponding changes in lung cytokines, lung inflammation or mortality reveals a surprising dissociation between systemic oxylipin and cytokine signaling pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggests that the cytokine storm is primarily responsible for morbidity and mortality in this animal model.", "metadata": {"pmid": "38786655", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "mesh_terms": []}}

Several randomized coronavirus disease 2019 trials, including the Multiplatform Randomized Clinical Trial (mpRCT), used Bayesian guidelines with the belief that they would lead to quicker efficacy or futility decisions than traditional \"frequentist\" guidelines, such as spending functions and conditional power. We explore this belief using an intuitive interpretation of Bayesian methods as translating prior opinion about the treatment effect into imaginary prior data. These imaginary observations are then combined with actual observations from the trial to make conclusions. Using this approach, we show that the Bayesian efficacy boundary used in mpRCT is actually quite similar to the frequentist Pocock boundary. The mpRCT's efficacy monitoring guideline considered stopping if, given the observed data, there was greater than 99% probability that the treatment was effective (odds ratio greater than 1). The mpRCT's futility monitoring guideline considered stopping if, given the observed data, there was greater than 95% probability that the treatment was less than 20% effective (odds ratio less than 1.2). The mpRCT used a normal prior distribution that can be thought of as supplementing the actual patients' data with imaginary patients' data. We explore the effects of varying probability thresholds and the prior-to-actual patient ratio in the mpRCT and compare the resulting Bayesian efficacy monitoring guidelines to the well-known frequentist Pocock and O'Brien-Fleming efficacy guidelines. We also contrast Bayesian futility guidelines with a more traditional 20% conditional power futility guideline. A Bayesian efficacy and futility monitoring boundary using a neutral, weakly informative prior distribution and a fixed probability threshold at all interim analyses is more aggressive than the commonly used O'Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary coupled with a 20% conditional power threshold for futility. The trade-off is that more aggressive boundaries tend to stop trials earlier, but incur a loss of power. Interestingly, the Bayesian efficacy boundary with 99% probability threshold is very similar to the classic Pocock efficacy boundary. In a pandemic where quickly weeding out ineffective treatments and identifying effective treatments is paramount, aggressive monitoring may be preferred to conservative approaches, such as the O'Brien-Fleming boundary.

We previously developed a computational framework, REAL-neo, for identification, quality control, and prioritization of both class-I and class-II human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-presented neoantigens resulting from somatic single-nucleotide mutations, small insertions and deletions, and gene fusions. In this study, we developed a new module, SPLICE-neo, to identify neoantigens from aberrant RNA transcripts from two distinct sources: (1) DNA mutations within splice sites and (2) de novo RNA aberrant splicings. First, SPLICE-neo was used to profile all DNA splice-site mutations in 11,892 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified 11 profiles of splicing donor or acceptor site gains or losses. Transcript isoforms resulting from the top seven most frequent profiles were computed using novel logic models. Second, SPLICE-neo identified de novo RNA splicing events using RNA sequencing reads mapped to novel exon junctions from either single, double, or multiple exon-skipping events. The aberrant transcripts from both sources were then ranked based on isoform expression levels and z-scores assuming that individual aberrant splicing events are rare. Finally, top-ranked novel isoforms were translated into protein, and the resulting neoepitopes were evaluated for neoantigen potential using REAL-neo. The top splicing neoantigen candidates binding to HLA-A*02:01 were validated using in vitro T2 binding assays. We identified abundant splicing neoantigens in four representative TCGA cancers: BRCA, LUAD, LUSC, and LIHC. In addition to their substantial contribution to neoantigen load, several splicing neoantigens were potent tumor antigens with stronger bindings to HLA compared with the positive control of antigens from influenza virus. SPLICE-neo is the first tool to comprehensively identify and prioritize splicing neoantigens from both DNA splice-site mutations and de novo RNA aberrant splicings. There are two major advances of SPLICE-neo. First, we developed novel logic models that assemble and prioritize full-length aberrant transcripts from DNA splice-site mutations.

In mice, a single dose of a preclinical version of mRNA-1273 vaccine encoding Wuhan-1 spike protein minimally imprinted serum responses elicited by Omicron boosters, enabling generation of type-specific antibodies. However, imprinting was observed in mice receiving an Omicron booster after two priming doses of mRNA-1273, an effect that was mitigated by a second booster dose of Omicron vaccine. In both SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected humans who received two Omicron-matched boosters after two or more doses of the prototype mRNA-1273 vaccine, spike-binding and neutralizing serum antibodies cross-reacted with Omicron variants as well as more distantly related sarbecoviruses. Because serum neutralizing responses against Omicron strains and other sarbecoviruses were abrogated after pre-clearing with Wuhan-1 spike protein, antibodies induced by XBB.1.5 boosting in humans focus on conserved epitopes targeted by the antecedent mRNA-1273 primary series. Thus, the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters in humans is imprinted by immunizations with historical mRNA-1273 vaccines, but this outcome may be beneficial as it drives expansion of cross-neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and distantly related sarbecoviruses.", "metadata": {"pmid": "38749479", "journal": "Nature", "mesh_terms": []}}

Cross-group protection depended on the presence of the human bnAb precursors within the B cell repertoire, and the vaccine-expanded antibodies enriched for an N55T substitution in the CDRH2 loop, a hallmark of the bnAb class. Structurally, this single mutation introduced a flexible fulcrum to accommodate glycosylation differences and could alone enable cross-group protection. Thus, broad IAV immunity can be expanded from the germline repertoire via minimal antigenic input and an exceptionally simple antibody development pathway.", "metadata": {"pmid": "38670113", "journal": "Immunity", "mesh_terms": []}}

The HA mAb inhibited de novo HA-specific antibodies, plasmablasts, germinal center B cells, and memory B cells, while responses to a second antigen in the vaccine, neuraminidase (NA), were uninhibited. The HA mAb potently inhibited de novo antibody responses against epitopes near the HA mAb binding site. The HA mAb also promoted IgG1 class switching, an effect that, unlike the inhibition of HA responses, relied on signaling through Fc-gamma receptors.

In a previous study, we identified a subset of human CD4 + T cells which express IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1). However, the expression of such receptor by viral antigen-specific CD4 + T cells and its biological implication remain largely unexplored. This led us to investigate the implication of IL-1R1 in the development of viral antigen-specific CD4 + T cell responses in humans, including healthy individuals and patients with primary antibody deficiency (PAD), and animals. We characterized CD4 + T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, influenza virus, and cytomegalovirus utilizing multiplexed single cell RNA-seq, mass cytometry and flow cytometry followed by an animal study. In healthy individuals, CD4 + T cells specific for viral antigens, including S protein, highly expressed IL-1R1. IL-1&#x3b2; promoted interferon (IFN)-&#x3b3; expression by S protein-stimulated CD4 + T cells, supporting the functional implication of IL-1R1. Following the 2nd dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, S protein-specific CD4 + T cells with high levels of IL-1R1 increased, likely reflecting repetitive antigenic stimulation. The expression levels of IL-1R1 by such cells correlated with the development of serum anti-S protein IgG antibody. A similar finding of increased expression of IL-1R1 by S protein-specific CD4 + T cells was also observed in patients with PAD following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination although the expression levels of IL-1R1 by such cells did not correlate with the levels of serum anti-S protein IgG antibody. In mice immunized with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, neutralizing IL-1R1 decreased IFN-&#x3b3; expression by S protein-specific CD4 + T cells and the development of anti-S protein IgG antibody. Our results demonstrate the significance of IL-1R1 expression in CD4 + T cells for the development of viral antigen-specific CD4 + T cell responses, contributing to humoral immunity.

Key genomic changes could occur in the genome's low-complexity regions (LCRs), which are challenging to sequence and are often dismissed as uninformative. Here, using a combination of highly sensitive techniques, we determine a high-quality MPXV genome sequence of a representative of the current epidemic with LCRs resolved at unprecedented accuracy. This reveals significant variation in short tandem repeats within LCRs. We demonstrate that LCR entropy in the MPXV genome is significantly higher than that of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and that LCRs are not randomly distributed.

A diverse set of pulmonary inflammatory stimuli, including resolved antecedent respiratory infections with S. aureus or influenza, ongoing pulmonary M. tuberculosis infection, ovalbumin/alum-induced asthma or airway administration of defined TLR ligands and recombinant cytokines, all establish an antiviral state in the lung that restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication upon infection.

In addition to helping elucidate immunological mechanisms, a CoP can serve as a valid surrogate endpoint for an infectious disease clinical outcome and thus qualifies as a primary endpoint for vaccine authorization or approval without requiring resource-intensive randomized, controlled phase 3 trials. Yet, it is challenging to persuasively validate a CoP, because a prognostic immune marker can fail as a reliable basis for predicting/inferring the level of vaccine efficacy against a clinical outcome, and because the statistical analysis of phase 3 trials only has limited capacity to disentangle association from cause. Moreover, the multitude of statistical methods garnered for CoP evaluation in phase 3 trials renders the comparison, interpretation, and synthesis of CoP results challenging. Toward promoting broader harmonization and standardization of CoP evaluation, this article summarizes four complementary statistical frameworks for evaluating CoPs in a phase 3 trial, focusing on the frameworks' distinct scientific objectives as measured and communicated by distinct causal vaccine efficacy parameters.

To address this, we evaluated the impact of aging on host and viral dynamics in a prospective, multicenter cohort of 1,031 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, ranging from 18 to 96 years of age. We performed blood transcriptomics and nasal metatranscriptomics, and measured peripheral blood immune cell populations, inflammatory protein expression, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and anti-interferon (IFN) autoantibodies. We found that older age correlated with an increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load at the time of admission, and with delayed viral clearance over 28 days. This contributed to an age-dependent increase in type I IFN gene expression in both the respiratory tract and blood. We also observed age-dependent transcriptional increases in peripheral blood IFN-&#x3b3;, neutrophil degranulation, and Toll like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, and decreases in T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor signaling pathways. Over time, older adults exhibited a remarkably sustained induction of proinflammatory genes (e.g., CXCL6 ) and serum chemokines (e.g., CXCL9) compared to younger individuals, highlighting a striking age-dependent impairment in inflammation resolution. Augmented inflammatory signaling also involved the upper airway, where aging was associated with upregulation of TLR, IL17, type I IFN and IL1 pathways, and downregulation TCR and PD-1 signaling pathways. Metatranscriptomics revealed that the oldest adults exhibited disproportionate reactivation of herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus in the upper airway following hospitalization. Mass cytometry demonstrated that aging correlated with reduced na&#xef;ve T and B cell populations, and increased monocytes and exhausted natural killer cells. Transcriptional and protein biomarkers of disease severity markedly differed with age, with the oldest adults exhibiting greater expression of TLR and inflammasome signaling genes, as well as proinflammatory proteins (e.g., IL6, CXCL8), in severe COVID-19 compared to mild/moderate disease.

The two complete IAV genomes were obtained by combining Illumina deep sequencing data from both total RNA and influenza viral genome-enriched libraries along with Sanger sequencing data from PCR across the sequencing gaps. This study confirms the previously reported 1918 IAV genomes and increases the total number of available complete or near-complete influenza viral genomes of the 1918 pandemic from four to six. Sequence comparisons among them confirm that the genomes of the 1918 pandemic virus were highly conserved during the main wave of the pandemic with geographic separation in North America and Europe. Metagenomic analyses revealed bacterial co-infections in both cases. Interestingly, in the Washington, DC, case, evidence is presented of the first reported Rhodococcus -influenza virus co-infection. This study applied modern molecular biotechnology and high-throughput sequencing to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy lung samples from two fatal cases during the fall wave of the 1918 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in the United States. Complete influenza genomes were obtained from both cases, which increases the total number of available complete or near-complete influenza genomes of the 1918 pandemic virus from four to six.

By contrast, people with advanced HIV showed elevated intra-host spike diversity with a median of 46 haplotypes per person (IQR 14-114). Higher intra-host spike diversity immediately after COVID-19 symptom onset predicted longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding among PWH, and intra-host spike diversity at this timepoint was significantly higher in people with advanced HIV than in PWOH. Composition of spike sequence populations in people with advanced HIV fluctuated rapidly over time, with founder sequences often replaced by groups of new haplotypes. These population-level changes were associated with a high total burden of intra-host mutations and positive selection at functionally important residues. In several cases, delayed emergence of detectable serum binding to spike was associated with positive selection for presumptive antibody-escape mutations.

As members of the Henipavirus genus, NiV and HeV use an attachment (G) glycoprotein and a class I fusion (F) glycoprotein to invade host cells. The F protein rearranges from a metastable prefusion form to an extended postfusion form to facilitate host cell entry. Prefusion NiV F elicits higher neutralizing antibody titers than postfusion NiV F, indicating that stabilization of prefusion F may aid vaccine development. A combination of amino acid substitutions (L104C/I114C, L172F, and S191P) is known to stabilize NiV F in its prefusion conformation, although the extent to which substitutions transfer to other henipavirus F proteins is not known. Here, we perform biophysical and structural studies to investigate the mechanism of prefusion stabilization in F proteins from three henipaviruses: NiV, HeV, and Langya virus (LayV). Three known stabilizing substitutions from NiV F transfer to HeV F and exert similar structural and functional effects. One engineered disulfide bond, located near the fusion peptide, is sufficient to stabilize the prefusion conformations of both HeV F and LayV F. Although LayV F shares low overall sequence identity with NiV F and HeV F, the region around the fusion peptide exhibits high sequence conservation across all henipaviruses. Our findings indicate that substitutions targeting this site of conformational change might be applicable to prefusion stabilization of other henipavirus F proteins and support the use of NiV as a prototypical pathogen for henipavirus vaccine antigen design.IMPORTANCEPathogenic henipaviruses such as Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) cause respiratory symptoms, with severe cases resulting in encephalitis, seizures, and coma. The work described here shows that the NiV and HeV fusion (F) proteins share common structural features with the F protein from an emerging henipavirus , Langya virus (LayV). Sequence alignment alone was sufficient to predict which known prefusion-stabilizing amino acid substitutions from NiV F would stabilize the prefusion conformations of HeV F and LayV F. This work also reveals an unexpected oligomeric interface shared by prefusion HeV F and NiV F. Together, these advances lay a foundation for future antigen design targeting henipavirus F proteins.

Using multi-omic immuoprofiling, we studied 86 SOT recipients in this cohort, who were age- and sex-matched 2:1 with 172 non-SOT controls. PBMC and nasal transcriptional profiling unexpectedly demonstrated upregulation of innate immune pathways related to interferon (IFN) and Toll-like receptor signaling, and complement activation, in SOT recipients. Longitudinal analyses across the first 30-days post-hospitalization demonstrated persistent upregulation of these innate immunity pathways in SOT recipients. The levels of several proinflammatory serum chemokines, such as CX3CL1 and KITLG, were also higher in SOT recipients at the time of hospitalization, although IFN-gamma levels were lower. We observed differential dynamics of CXCL11, which remained persistently elevated in SOT recipients over the course of hospitalization. Nasal microbiome alpha diversity was higher in SOT recipients versus controls, but no differences in taxonomic abundance beyond SARS-CoV-2 were observed. SOT recipients had higher nasal SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and impaired viral clearance compared to controls. Antibody analysis demonstrated lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG levels in SOT recipients upon hospitalization, but no distinctions over time compared to controls. Mass cytometry demonstrated marked differences in blood immune cell populations, with SOT recipients exhibiting decreased plasmablasts and transitional B cells, and increased senescent T cells. Severe disease in SOT recipients was characterized by a less robust induction of inflammatory chemokines, such as IL-6 and CCL7, and a more subtle proinflammatory transcriptional response in the blood and airway.

We unexpectedly find that SOT recipients exhibit an augmented, predominantly innate immune response in both the blood and upper respiratory tract that remains relatively stable across disease severity, in contrast to non-SOT controls. These findings may relate to the paradoxical observation that SOT recipients have similar COVID-19 mortality rates versus the general population, despite being more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, remaining infectious longer, and having higher rates of hospitalization.

By vaccinating and challenging healthy volunteers, we demonstrated that inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) modestly reduced the rate of influenza while predominantly boosting serum antibody titers against hemagglutinin (HA) and HA stalk, a consequence of the low neuraminidase (NA) content of IIV and the intramuscular route of administration. The viral challenge induced nasal and serum responses against both HA and NA. Correlations between mucosal IgA and serum IgG against specific antigens were low, whether before or after challenge, suggesting a compartmentalization of immune responses. Even so, volunteers who developed viral shedding for multiple days had lower baseline titers across both systemic and mucosal compartments as compared to those with no shedding or a single day of shedding. Regression analysis showed that pre-challenge HA inhibition titers were the most consistent correlate of protection across clinical outcomes combining shedding and symptoms, with NA inhibition titers and HA IgG levels only predicting the duration of shedding. Despite the inclusion of data from multiple binding and functional antibody assays against HA and NA performed on both serum and nasal samples, multivariate models were unable to account for the variability in outcomes, emphasizing our imperfect understanding of immune correlates in influenza and the importance of refining models with assessments of innate and cellular immune responses.IMPORTANCEThe devastating potential of influenza has been well known for over 100 years. Despite the development of vaccines since the middle of the 20th century, influenza continues to be responsible for substantial global morbidity and mortality. To develop next-generation vaccines with enhanced effectiveness, we must synthesize our understanding of the complex immune mechanisms culminating in protection. Our study outlines the differences in immune responses to influenza vaccine and influenza infection, identifying potential gaps in vaccine-induced immunity, particularly at the level of the nasal mucosa. Furthermore, this research underscores the need to refine our imperfect models while recognizing potential pitfalls in past and future attempts to identify and measure correlates of protection.", "metadata": {"pmid": "38193710", "journal": "mBio", "mesh_terms": []}}

One group of nAbs elicited by the ancestral spike lacking diproline substitutions targeted the outer face of the receptor binding domain (RBD), neutralized all tested SARS-CoV-2 VOCs including Omicron XBB.1.5, but lacked cross-Sarbecovirus neutralization.

This reciprocal response is coupled to unopposed and restricted expression of viral genes in control and SP-R210 L -deficient macrophages, respectively. Human monocytic cells with sub-stoichiometric expression of SP-R210 L resist IAV infection, whereas alveolar macrophages with increased abundance of SP-R210 L permit viral gene expression similar to murine macrophages.

Neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection and are used for immunobridging studies within and between vaccine platforms for approval of new COVID-19 vaccines. In preparation for the next pandemic, it is vital that rapidly authorized initial vaccines are available to perform immunobridging studies very early. Additional components of the immune response likely contribute to protection against symptomatic infection. Current evidence is strongest for T lymphocytes and binding antibodies. Further studies are needed to consolidate this evidence and define their potential role in the evaluation of vaccines.

Mortality from acute flares approaches 30% due to lack of effective therapies. We evaluated a monoclonal antibody (4E2) specific for the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 in ISCLS models. 4E2 activated Tie2 in ISCLS patient-derived endothelial cells and reduced baseline and proinflammatory mediator-induced barrier dysfunction. 4E2 also reduced mortality and/or vascular leakage associated with systemic histamine challenge or influenza infection in the SJL/J mouse model of ISCLS.

To accomplish this aim, we built machine-learning models to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in a NHP model of subclinical disease using baseline-normalized radiomic and blood sample analyses data from SARS-CoV-2-exposed and control (mock-exposed) crab-eating macaques. We applied a novel adaptation of the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature-selection technique, called mRMR-permute, for statistically-thresholded and unbiased feature selection. Through performance comparison of eight machine-learning models trained on 14 feature sets, we demonstrated that a logistic regression model trained on the mRMR-permute feature set can predict SARS-CoV-2 infection with very high accuracy. Eighty-nine percent of mRMR-permute selected features had strong and significant class effects. Through this work, we identified a key set of radiomic and blood biomarkers that can be used to predict infection status even in the absence of clinical signs.

Neutralizing antibody to NiV has been proposed as the principal mediator of protection against future NiV infection. Two approaches were used to determine the correlation between neutralizing antibody levels and outcomes following a severe (1,000 median lethal doses) intranasal/intratracheal (IN/IT) challenge with NiV (Bangladesh): (1) reduction in vaccine dose given 28 days before challenge and (2) challenge during the early phase of the antibody response to the vaccine. Reduction in vaccine dose to very low levels led to primary vaccine failure rather than a sub-protective level of antibody. All AGMs vaccinated with the nominal clinical dose (2 &#xd7; 10 7 pfu) at 21, 14, or 7 days before challenge survived. AGMs vaccinated at 21 days before challenge had neutralizing antibodies (geometric mean titer, 71.3). AGMs vaccinated at 7 or 14 days before challenge had either undetectable or low neutralizing antibody titers pre-challenge but had a rapid rise in titers after challenge that abrogated the NiV infection. A simple logistic regression model of the combined studies was used, in which the sole explanatory variable was pre-challenge neutralizing antibody titers. For a pre-challenge titer of 1:5, the predicted survival probability is 100%. The majority of animals with pre-challenge neutralizing titer of &#x2265;1:20 were protected against pulmonary infiltrates on thoracic radiograms, and a majority of those with titers &#x2265;1:40 were protected against clinical signs of illness and against a &#x2265;fourfold antibody increase following challenge (indicating sterile immunity). Controls receiving rVSV-Ebola vaccine rapidly succumbed to NiV challenge, eliminating the innate immunity stimulated by the rVSV vector as a contributor to survival in monkeys challenged as early as 7 days after vaccination.

Importantly, we found that K18-hACE2 transgenic mice infected with SCV2 one month before, or months after aerosol Mtb exposure did not display exacerbated Mtb infection-associated pathology, weight loss, nor did they have increased pulmonary bacterial loads. However, pre-existing Mtb infection at the time of exposure to the ancestral SCV2 strain in infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice or the beta variant (B.1.351) in WT C57Bl/6 mice significantly limited early SCV2 replication in the lung. Mtb -driven protection against SCV2 increased with higher bacterial doses and did not require IFN-I, TLR2 or TLR9 signaling.

We conducted a phase 3, parallel, randomised, modified double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults aged 18 years or older at 54 clinical research centres in eight countries (Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, Uganda, and Ukraine). Participants were recruited from the community and randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive response technology system to receive two intramuscular 0&#xb7;5 mL injections, 21 days apart, of the bivalent vaccine (5 &#x3bc;g of ancestral [D614] and 5 &#x3bc;g of beta [B.1.351] variant spike protein, with AS03 adjuvant) or placebo (0&#xb7;9% normal saline).

Symptomatic COVID-19 was defined as laboratory-confirmed (via nucleic acid amplification test or PCR test) COVID-19 with COVID-19-like illness symptoms. The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical efficacy of the bivalent vaccine for prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 at least 14 days after the second injection (dose 2).

One emerging strategy for the development of more efficacious seasonal and universal influenza vaccines is structure-guided design of nanoparticles that display conserved regions of HA, such as the stem. Using the H1 HA subtype to establish proof of concept, we found that tandem copies of an alpha-helical fragment from the conserved stem region (helix-A) can be displayed on the protruding spikes structures of a capsid scaffold. The stem region of HA on these designed chimeric nanoparticles is immunogenic and the nanoparticles are biochemically robust in that heat exposure did not destroy the particles and immunogenicity was retained. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with H1-nanoparticles were protected from lethal challenge with H1N1 influenza virus. By using a nanoparticle library approach with this helix-A nanoparticle design, we show that this vaccine nanoparticle construct design could be applicable to different influenza HA subtypes. Importantly, antibodies elicited by H1, H5, and H7 nanoparticles demonstrated homosubtypic and heterosubtypic cross-reactivity binding to different HA subtypes. Also, helix-A nanoparticle immunizations were used to isolate mouse monoclonal antibodies that demonstrated heterosubtypic cross-reactivity and provided protection to mice from viral challenge via passive-transfer. This tandem helix-A nanoparticle construct represents a novel design to display several hundred copies of non-trimeric conserved HA stem epitopes on vaccine nanoparticles. This design concept provides a new approach to universal influenza vaccine development strategies and opens opportunities for the development of nanoparticles with broad coverage over many antigenically diverse influenza HA subtypes.", "metadata": {"pmid": "37639457", "journal": "PLoS pathogens", "mesh_terms": []}}

We reviewed the origins of all Ebola disease outbreaks from 1976 to 2022 to analyze the earliest cases and characteristics of each outbreak. The epidemiology and phylogenetic relationships of outbreak strains were used to further identify the likely source of each outbreak. From 1976 to 2022 there were 35 Ebola disease outbreaks with 48 primary/index cases. While the majority of outbreaks were associated with wildlife spillover, resurgence of human-to-human transmission could account for roughly a quarter of outbreaks caused by Ebola virus. Larger outbreaks were more likely to lead to possible resurgence, and nosocomial transmission was associated with the majority of outbreaks. While spillover from wildlife has been a source for many Ebola disease outbreaks, multiple outbreaks may have originated from flare-ups of prior outbreak strains.

Blood specimens were collected from contacts within 30-60 days of index case diagnosis; and serum was tested for presence of spike and nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 prior infections among household contacts was defined based on the presence of both spike and nucleocapsid antibodies. We fitted a chain binomial model to the serologic data, to account for exogenous community infection risk and potential multi-generational transmissions within the household. Overall seroprevalence was 53% (95% confidence interval (CI) 48-58%) among household contacts. The estimated household secondary attack rate is 34% (95% CI 5-75%). Mask wearing by the index case is associated with the household transmission risk reduction by 67% (adjusted odds ratio&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.33 with 95% CI: 0.09-0.75) and not sharing bedroom with the index case is associated with the risk reduction of household transmission by 78% (adjusted odds ratio&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22 with 95% CI 0.10-0.41).

Here, we show that Omicron exhibits increased infectivity in primary adult upper airway tissue relative to Delta. Using recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 and nasal epithelial cells cultured at the liquid-air interface, enhanced infectivity maps to the step of cellular entry and evolved recently through mutations unique to Omicron Spike. Unlike earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2, Omicron enters nasal cells independently of serine transmembrane proteases and instead relies upon metalloproteinases to catalyze membrane fusion. This entry pathway unlocked by Omicron Spike enables evasion of constitutive and interferon-induced antiviral factors that restrict SARS-CoV-2 entry following attachment. Therefore, the increased transmissibility exhibited by Omicron in humans may be attributed not only to its evasion of vaccine-elicited adaptive immunity, but also to its superior invasion of nasal epithelia and resistance to the cell-intrinsic barriers present therein.", "metadata": {"pmid": "37425811", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "mesh_terms": []}}

Novel ways of broadly sampling the human population in a non-invasive method would allow for large-scale surveillance at a reduced cost. Here we evaluate the collection of naturally bloodfed mosquitoes to test for human anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the laboratory and at five field locations in Mali.

This epitope overlaps substantially with the spike protein N-terminal domain (NTD) -interacting region and is exposed only when the spike is in the open conformation, with one or more RBDs accessible. WRAIR-2063 binds the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 WA-1, all variants of concern (VoCs), and clade 1 to 4 sarbecoviruses with high affinity, demonstrating the conservation of this epitope and potential resiliency against variation.

In this observational cohort study, we studied self-reported pregnancies in two groups: seropositive people who had recovered from Ebola virus disease (seropositive group) and seronegative people who had close contact with people with Ebola (seronegative group). Participants had enrolled in the PREVAIL III longitudinal study and were exposed during the 2014-2016 Liberian Ebola outbreak. The primary outcome was pregnancy result. We assessed rates of livebirths and other pregnancy results in both study groups, and presence of Ebola RNA by PCR in samples of placenta, maternal and cord blood, breastmilk, and vaginal secretions from people who had recovered from Ebola who conceived a median of 14 months after acute Ebola virus disease. Mixed-model logistic regression evaluated associations between first-reported pregnancy outcome, age, and study group. Growth and neurodevelopment in the infants born to people in the seropositive group were assessed at 6-month intervals for 2 years. Data were accrued by PREVAIL III study staff. 1566 participants were enrolled between June 17, 2015, and Dec 14, 2017, of whom 639 became pregnant (215 seropositive, 424 seronegative) and 589 reported pregnancy outcomes (206 seropositive, 383 seronegative). 105 infants born to 98 mothers in the seropositive group were enrolled in the birth cohort. Ebola RNA was not detected in 205 samples of placenta, cord blood, or maternal blood taken at birth from 54 mothers in the seropositive group, nor in 367 vaginal swabs. Viral RNA was found in two of 354 longitudinal breastmilk samples. All but one of 57 infants born during these 54 births were seropositive for anti-Ebola antibodies. Neonates showed high concentrations of anti-Ebola IgG, which declined after 6 months. Odds of adverse pregnancy outcome among the two groups were indistinguishable (OR 1&#xb7;13, 95% CI 0&#xb7;71-1&#xb7;79). Compared with WHO standards, infants born to those in the seropositive group had lower median weight and length, and larger median head circumference over 2 years. Compared with a cohort from the USA accrual of gross motor developmental milestones was similar, whereas attainment of pincer grasp and early vocalisation were mildly delayed. The risks of Ebola virus reactivation in the peripartum and postpartum period and of adverse birth outcomes are low in those who have recovered from Ebola virus disease and become pregnant approximately 1 year after acute Ebola virus disease. The implication for clinical practice is that care of people who are pregnant and who have recovered from Ebola can be offered without risks to health-care providers or stigmatisation of the mothers and their offspring. The implication for prospective mothers is that safe pregnancies are entirely possible after recovery from Ebola.

Aviptadil, a lung-protective neuropeptide, and remdesivir, a nucleotide prodrug of an adenosine analog, were compared with placebo among patients with COVID-19 acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. TESICO was a randomised trial of aviptadil and remdesivir versus placebo at 28 sites in the USA. Hospitalised adult patients were eligible for the study if they had acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and were within 4 days of the onset of respiratory failure. Participants could be randomly assigned to both study treatments in a 2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;2 factorial design or to just one of the agents. Participants were randomly assigned with a web-based application. For each site, randomisation was stratified by disease severity (high-flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), and four strata were defined by remdesivir and aviptadil eligibility, as follows: (1) eligible for randomisation to aviptadil and remdesivir in the 2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;2 factorial design; participants were equally randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to intravenous aviptadil plus remdesivir, aviptadil plus remdesivir matched placebo, aviptadil matched placebo plus remdesvir, or aviptadil placebo plus remdesivir placebo; (2) eligible for randomisation to aviptadil only because remdesivir was started before randomisation; (3) eligible for randomisation to aviptadil only because remdesivir was contraindicated; and (4) eligible for randomisation to remdesivir only because aviptadil was contraindicated. For participants in strata 2-4, randomisation was 1:1 to the active agent or matched placebo. Aviptadil was administered as a daily 12-h infusion for 3 days, targeting 600 pmol/kg on infusion day 1, 1200 pmol/kg on day 2, and 1800 pmol/kg on day 3. Remdesivir was administered as a 200 mg loading dose, followed by 100 mg daily maintenance doses for up to a 10-day total course. For participants assigned to placebo for either agent, matched saline placebo was administered in identical volumes. For both treatment comparisons, the primary outcome, assessed at day 90, was a six-category ordinal outcome: (1) at home (defined as the type of residence before hospitalisation) and off oxygen (recovered) for at least 77 days, (2) at home and off oxygen for 49-76 days, (3) at home and off oxygen for 1-48 days, (4) not hospitalised but either on supplemental oxygen or not at home, (5) hospitalised or in hospice care, or (6) dead. Mortality up to day 90 was a key secondary outcome. The independent data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the aviptadil trial on May 25, 2022, for futility. On June 9, 2022, the sponsor stopped the trial of remdesivir due to slow enrolment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04843761. Between April 21, 2021, and May 24, 2022, we enrolled 473 participants in the study. For the aviptadil comparison, 471 participants were randomly assigned to aviptadil or matched placebo. The modified intention-to-treat population comprised 461 participants who received at least a partial infusion of aviptadil (231 participants) or aviptadil matched placebo (230 participants). For the remdesivir comparison, 87 participants were randomly assigned to remdesivir or matched placebo and all received some infusion of remdesivir (44 participants) or remdesivir matched placebo (43 participants). 85 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses for both agents (ie, those enrolled in the 2&#x2009;x&#x2009;2 factorial). For the aviptadil versus placebo comparison, the median age was 57 years (IQR 46-66), 178 (39%) of 461 participants were female, and 246 (53%) were Black, Hispanic, Asian or other (vs 215 [47%] White participants). 431 (94%) of 461 participants were in an intensive care unit at baseline, with 271 (59%) receiving high-flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventiliation, 185 (40%) receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, and five (1%) receiving ECMO. The odds ratio (OR) for being in a better category of the primary efficacy endpoint for aviptadil versus placebo at day 90, from a model stratified by baseline disease severity, was 1&#xb7;11 (95% CI 0&#xb7;80-1&#xb7;55; p=0&#xb7;54). Up to day 90, 86 participants in the aviptadil group and 83 in the placebo group died. The cumulative percentage who died up to day 90 was 38% in the aviptadil group and 36% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1&#xb7;04, 95% CI 0&#xb7;77-1&#xb7;41; p=0&#xb7;78). The primary safety outcome of death, serious adverse events, organ failure, serious infection, or grade 3 or 4 adverse events up to day 5 occurred in 146 (63%) of 231 patients in the aviptadil group compared with 129 (56%) of 230 participants in the placebo group (OR 1&#xb7;40, 95% CI 0&#xb7;94-2&#xb7;08; p=0&#xb7;10). Among patients with COVID-19-associated acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, aviptadil did not significantly improve clinical outcomes up to day 90 when compared with placebo.

Vast amounts of data have been gathered on SARS-CoV-2 antibody response; however, performance and ability to compare the results have been challenging. This study seeks to analyze the reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of a set of widely used commercial, in-house, and neutralization serology assays, as well as provide evidence for the feasibility of using the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard (IS) as a harmonization tool. This study also seeks to demonstrate that binding immunoassays may serve as a practical alternative for the serological study of large sample sets in lieu of expensive, complex, and less reproducible neutralization assays. In this study, commercial assays demonstrated the highest specificity, while in-house assays excelled in antibody sensitivity. As expected, neutralization assays demonstrated high levels of variability but overall good correlations with binding immunoassays, suggesting that binding may be reasonably accurate as well as practical for the study of SARS-CoV-2 serology. All three assay types performed well after WHO IS standardization. The results of this study demonstrate there are high performing serology assays available to the scientific community to rigorously dissect antibody responses to infection and vaccination. IMPORTANCE Previous studies have shown significant variability in SARS-CoV-2 antibody serology assays, highlighting the need for evaluation and comparison of these assays using the same set of samples covering a wide range of antibody responses induced by infection or vaccination. This study demonstrated that there are high performing assays that can be used reliably to evaluate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the context of infection and vaccination. This study also demonstrated the feasibility of harmonizing these assays against the International Standard and provided evidence that the binding immunoassays may have high enough correlation with the neutralization assays to serve as a practical proxy.

However, the role of hepatic involvement in EVD progression is understudied. Medical imaging in established animal models of EVD (e.g., nonhuman primates [NHPs]) can be a strong complement to traditional assays to better investigate this pathophysiological process in vivo and noninvasively. In this proof-of-concept study, we used longitudinal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize liver morphology and function in nine rhesus monkeys after exposure to Ebola virus (EBOV). Starting 5&#x2009;days postexposure, MRI assessments of liver appearance, morphology, and size were consistently compatible with the presence of hepatic edema, inflammation, and congestion, leading to significant hepatomegaly at necropsy. MRI performed after injection of a hepatobiliary contrast agent demonstrated decreased liver signal on the day of euthanasia, suggesting progressive hepatocellular dysfunction and hepatic secretory impairment associated with EBOV infection. Importantly, MRI-assessed deterioration of biliary function was acute and progressed faster than changes in serum bilirubin concentrations. These findings suggest that longitudinal quantitative in vivo imaging may be a useful addition to standard biological assays to gain additional knowledge about organ pathophysiology in animal models of EVD.

We evaluated the clinical, genetic, immunologic, and prognostic characteristics of 108 patients who were enrolled during an 11-year period. We performed whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing to identify genetic causes of lymphopenia.

Here, we evaluated the B cell response to H1ssF in healthy adults ages 18 to 70 in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03814720). We observed both a strong plasmablast response and sustained elicitation of cross-reactive HA stem-specific memory B cells after vaccination with H1ssF in individuals of all ages. The B cell response was focused on two conserved epitopes on the H1 stem, with a highly restricted immunoglobulin repertoire unique to each epitope. On average, two-thirds of the B cell and serological antibody response recognized a central epitope on the H1 stem and exhibited broad neutralization across group 1 influenza virus subtypes. The remaining third recognized an epitope near the viral membrane anchor and was largely limited to H1 strains. Together, we demonstrate that an H1 HA immunogen lacking the immunodominant HA head produces a robust and broadly neutralizing HA stem-directed B cell response.", "metadata": {"pmid": "37075126", "journal": "Science translational medicine", "mesh_terms": []}}

Although several vaccines have received emergency approval through various public health agencies, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues. Emergent variants of concern, waning immunity in the vaccinated, evidence that vaccines may not prevent transmission and inequity in vaccine distribution have driven continued development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to address these public health needs. In this report, we evaluated a novel self-amplifying replicon RNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in a pigtail macaque model of COVID-19 disease. We found that this vaccine elicited strong binding and neutralizing antibody responses against homologous virus. We also observed broad binding antibody against heterologous contemporary and ancestral strains, but neutralizing antibody responses were primarily targeted to the vaccine-homologous strain. While binding antibody responses were sustained, neutralizing antibody waned to undetectable levels in some animals after six months but were rapidly recalled and conferred protection from disease when the animals were challenged 7 months after vaccination as evident by reduced viral replication and pathology in the lower respiratory tract, reduced viral shedding in the nasal cavity and lower concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate in pigtail macaques that a self-amplifying replicon RNA vaccine can elicit durable and protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, these data provide evidence that this vaccine can provide durable protective efficacy and reduce viral shedding even after neutralizing antibody responses have waned to undetectable levels.", "metadata": {"pmid": "37075079", "journal": "PLoS pathogens", "mesh_terms": []}}

The pathogenesis of MVD remains poorly understood, partially due to the low number of cases that can be studied, the absence of state-of-the-art medical equipment in areas where cases are reported, and limitations on the number of animals that can be safely used in experimental studies under maximum containment animal biosafety level 4 conditions. Medical imaging modalities, such as whole-body computed tomography (CT), may help to describe disease progression in vivo , potentially replacing ethically contentious and logistically challenging serial euthanasia studies. Towards this vision, we performed a pilot study, during which we acquired whole-body CT images of 6 rhesus monkeys before and 7 to 9&#x2009;days after intramuscular MARV exposure. We identified imaging abnormalities in the liver, spleen, and axillary lymph nodes that corresponded to clinical, virological, and gross pathological hallmarks of MVD in this animal model. Quantitative image analysis indicated hepatomegaly with a significant reduction in organ density (indicating fatty infiltration of the liver), splenomegaly, and edema that corresponded with gross pathological and histopathological findings. Our results indicated that CT imaging could be used to verify and quantify typical MVD pathogenesis versus altered, diminished, or absent disease severity or progression in the presence of candidate medical countermeasures, thus possibly reducing the number of animals needed and eliminating serial euthanasia.

In this work, we sought to complement those efforts by adding a systematic and quantitative study of the research foundations that led to these vaccines. Here, we analyzed citations from COVID-19 vaccine research articles to determine which scientific areas of study contributed the most to this research. Our findings revealed that coronavirus research was cited most often, and by a large margin.

In addition, we examined the publication history of the most prolific authors of COVID-19 vaccine research to determine their research expertise prior to the pandemic. Interestingly, although COVID-19 vaccine research relied most heavily on previous coronavirus work, we find that the most prolific authors on these publications most often had expertise in other areas including influenza, cancer, and HIV/AIDS. Finally, we used machine learning to identify and group together publications based on their major topic areas. This allowed us to elucidate the differences in citations between research areas.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated PWH with clinical, antibody-confirmed COVID-19 as of September 2021 were matched on geographic region, age, and sample timing to antibody negative controls. For cases and controls, pre COVID-19 pandemic specimens were obtained prior to January 2020 to assess change over time and relationship to COVID-19 severity, using false-discovery adjusted mixed effects modeling. We compared 257 unique plasma proteins in 94 COVID-19 antibody-confirmed clinical cases and 113 matched antibody-negative controls, excluding COVID-19 vaccinated participants (age 50 years, 73% male). 40% of cases were characterized as mild; 60% moderate to severe. Median time from COVID-19 infection to follow-up sampling was 4 months. Temporal patterns of protein changes differed based on COVID-19 disease severity.

Preclinical studies enable rigorous control of experimental conditions as well as pre-exposure baseline and longitudinal measurements, including medical imaging, that are often unavailable in the clinical research setting. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging provides important diagnostic, prognostic, and disease characterization to clinicians and clinical researchers. In that context, automated deep-learning systems for the analysis of CT imaging have been broadly proposed, but their practical utility has been limited. Manual outlining of the ground truth (i.e., lung-lesions) requires accurate distinctions between abnormal and normal tissues that often have vague boundaries and is subject to reader heterogeneity in interpretation. Indeed, this subjectivity is demonstrated as wide inconsistency in manual outlines among experts and from the same expert. The application of deep-learning data-science tools has been less well-evaluated in the preclinical setting, including in nonhuman primate (NHP) models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection/COVID-19, in which the translation of human-derived deep-learning tools is challenging. The automated segmentation of the whole lung and lung lesions provides a potentially standardized and automated method to detect and quantify disease. We used deep-learning-based quantification of the whole lung and lung lesions on CT scans of NHPs exposed to SARS-CoV-2. We proposed a novel multi-model ensemble technique to address the inconsistency in the ground truths for deep-learning-based automated segmentation of the whole lung and lung lesions. Multiple models were obtained by training the convolutional neural network (CNN) on different subsets of the training data instead of having a single model using the entire training dataset. Moreover, we employed a feature pyramid network (FPN), a CNN that provides predictions at different resolution levels, enabling the network to predict objects with wide size variations. We achieved an average of 99.4 and 60.2% Dice coefficients for whole-lung and lung-lesion segmentation, respectively. The proposed multi-model FPN outperformed well-accepted methods U-Net (50.5%), V-Net (54.5%), and Inception (53.4%) for the challenging lesion-segmentation task. We show the application of segmentation outputs for longitudinal quantification of lung disease in SARS-CoV-2-exposed and mock-exposed NHPs.

Surfactant Protein A (SP-A) is a calcium-dependent opsonin that binds a variety of pathogens to help control pulmonary infections by alveolar macrophages. Alveolar macrophages play critical roles in host resistance and susceptibility to IAV infection. The effect of SP-A on IAV infection and antiviral response of macrophages, however, is not understood. Here, we report that SP-A attenuates IAV infection in a dose-dependent manner at the level of endosomal trafficking, resulting in infection delay in a model macrophage cell line. The ability of SP-A to suppress infection was independent of its glycosylation status. Binding of SP-A to hemagglutinin did not rely on the glycosylation status or sugar binding properties of either protein. Incubation of either macrophages or IAV with SP-A slowed endocytic uptake rate of IAV. SP-A interfered with binding to cell membrane and endosomal exit of the viral genome as indicated by experiments using isolated cell membranes, an antibody recognizing a pH-sensitive conformational epitope on hemagglutinin, and microscopy. Lack of SP-A in mice enhanced IFN&#x3b2; expression, viral clearance and reduced mortality from IAV infection. These findings support the idea that IAV is an opportunistic pathogen that co-opts SP-A to evade host defense by alveolar macrophages. Our study highlights novel aspects of host-pathogen interactions that may lead to better understanding of the local mechanisms that shape activation of antiviral and inflammatory responses to viral infection in the lung.", "metadata": {"pmid": "36960051", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "mesh_terms": []}}

Precision treatment with the anti-IL-4R&#x3b1; antibody, dupilumab, was highly effective improving both clinical manifestations and immunological biomarkers.

Influenza A viral genetic exchange can occur when genome segments from distinct strains reassort in coinfected cells. Predicting potential genomic reassortment between influenza strains has been a long-standing goal. Experimental coinfection studies have shed light on factors that limit or promote reassortment. However, determining the reassortment potential between diverse Influenza A strains has remained elusive. To address this challenge, we developed a high throughput genotyping approach to quantify reassortment among a diverse panel of human influenza virus strains encompassing two pandemics (swine and avian origin), three specific epidemics, and both circulating human subtypes A/H1N1 and A/H3N2. We found that reassortment frequency (the proportion of reassortants generated) is an emergent property of specific pairs of strains where strain identity is a predictor of reassortment frequency. We detect little evidence that antigenic subtype drives reassortment as intersubtype (H1N1xH3N2) and intrasubtype reassortment frequencies were, on average, similar. Instead, our data suggest that certain strains bias the reassortment frequency up or down, independently of the coinfecting partner. We observe that viral productivity is also an emergent property of coinfections, but uncorrelated to reassortment frequency; thus viral productivity is a separate factor affecting the total number of reassortants produced. Assortment of individual segments among progeny and pairwise segment combinations within progeny generally favored homologous combinations. These outcomes were not related to strain similarity or shared subtype but reassortment frequency was closely correlated to the proportion of both unique genotypes and of progeny with heterologous pairwise segment combinations. We provide experimental evidence that viral genetic exchange is potentially an individual social trait subject to natural selection, which implies the propensity for reassortment is not evenly shared among strains. This study highlights the need for research incorporating diverse strains to discover the traits that shift the reassortment potential to realize the goal of predicting influenza virus evolution resulting from segment exchange.", "metadata": {"pmid": "36857394", "journal": "PLoS pathogens", "mesh_terms": []}}

Animals received a 1 mL intramuscular injection for vaccination containing either 1&#x2008;&#xd7;&#x2008;10 7 plaque forming units (PFU) VSV-SUDV or 1&#x2008;&#xd7;&#x2008;10 7 PFU of a VSV-based vaccine against Marburg virus (control; five NHPs). NHPs were challenged intramuscularly 28 days after vaccination with 1&#x2008;&#xd7;&#x2008;10 4 TCID 50 SUDV-Gulu. We assessed anaesthetised NHPs on days 28, 21, 14, and 7 before challenge; days 0, 3, 6, 9, 14, 21, 28, and 35 after challenge; and at euthanasia (day 40 for survivors). As we repurposed NHPs from a successful VSV-Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine efficacy study, we also investigated VSV-EBOV's cross-protective potential against SUDV challenge. Of the six NHPs given VSV-SUDV, none showed any signs of disease in response to the challenge. Four of the five NHPs in the control group developed characteristic clinical signs of Sudan virus diseases. SUDV glycoprotein-specific IgG concentrations peaked 14 days after vaccination (titre of &gt;1:10&#x2008;000) and reached their highest concentrations at 6 days after challenge (1:25&#x2008;600-1:102&#x2008;400). Although the NHPs developed cross-reactive humoral responses to SUDV after VSV-EBOV vaccination and EBOV challenge, there was little cross-protection. These data emphasise the need for species-specific vaccines for each human-pathogenic Ebolavirus. Furthermore, although previous VSV-EBOV immunity is boosted through VSV-SUDV vaccination, it only has a small effect on the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of VSV-SUDV vaccination against SUDV challenge.

Furthermore, colonization-associated dysbiosis of the commensal microbiota can alter host immunocompetence and infection outcomes. Here, we investigated the role of Bordetella bronchiseptica nasal colonization and associated disruption of the nasal microbiota on the ability of influenza A virus to establish infection in the murine upper respiratory tract. Targeted sequencing of the microbial 16S rRNA gene revealed that B. bronchiseptica colonization of the nasal cavity efficiently displaced the resident commensal microbiota-the peak of this effect occurring 7&#x2009;days postcolonization-and was associated with reduced influenza associated-morbidity and enhanced recovery from influenza-associated clinical disease. Anti-influenza A virus hemagglutinin-specific humoral immune responses were not affected by B. bronchiseptica colonization, although the cellular influenza PA-specific CD8 + immune responses were dampened. Notably, influenza A virus replication in the nasal cavity was negated in B. bronchiseptica-colonized mice. Collectively, this work demonstrates that B. bronchiseptica-mediated pathogen interference prevents influenza A virus replication in the murine nasal cavity. This may have direct implications for controlling influenza A virus replication in, and transmission events originating from, the upper respiratory tract. IMPORTANCE The interplay of microbial species in the upper respiratory tract is important for the ability of an incoming pathogen to establish and, in the case of pathogenic organisms, cause disease in a host. Here, we demonstrate that B. bronchiseptica efficiently colonizes and concurrently displaces the commensal nasal cavity microbiota, negating the ability of influenza A virus to establish infection. Furthermore, B. bronchiseptica colonization also reduced influenza-associated morbidity and enhanced recovery from influenza-associated disease. Collectively, this study indicates that B. bronchiseptica-mediated interference prevents influenza A virus replication in the upper respiratory tract. This result demonstrates the potential for respiratory pathogen-mediated interference to control replication and transmission dynamics of a clinically important respiratory pathogen like influenza A virus.", "metadata": {"pmid": "36728413", "journal": "Microbiology spectrum", "mesh_terms": []}}

Such antibodies are complex molecules associated with multi-faceted mechanisms of action that require appropriate bioassays to ensure product quality and manufacturing consistency. We developed procedures for biolayer interferometry (BLI) and a cell-based virus neutralisation assay, the focus reduction neutralisation test (FRNT). Using both assays, we tested a panel of five BsAbs against different spike variants (Ancestral, Delta and Omicron) to evaluate the use of these analytical methods in assessing binding and neutralisation activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. We found comparable trends between BLI-derived binding affinity and FRNT-based virus neutralisation activity.

Many studies have measured ehCoV 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 antibody levels weeks after recovery rather than in the first weeks of illness, which is more relevant to early hospitalizations. Antibody levels to the spike protein of the four coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1), as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were measured both before and immediately after convalescent or control plasma transfusion in 51 participants who were hospitalized and 250 who were not hospitalized, as well as in 71 convalescent and 50 control plasma donors as a subset from a completed randomized controlled trial. In COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors, the ehCoV spike antibodies were 1.2 to 2 times greater than the control donor unit levels, while donor COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies were more than 600 times the control plasma units. Plasma transfusion, whether COVID-19 convalescent or control, did not alter the post-transfusion antibody levels for the endemic human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) in those hospitalized and not hospitalized, despite the 1.2- to 2-fold elevation in donor COVID-19 convalescent plasma. There was no influence of prior antibody levels to 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 or post-transfusion antibody levels on subsequent hospitalization. These data, from a well-controlled prospective randomized clinical trial, add evidence that antibodies to ehCoV do not significantly impact COVID-19 outcomes, despite the apparent back-boosting of some ehCoV after SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE The relevance of preexisting immunity to the four endemic human coronaviruses in the first week of COVID-19 illness on the outcome of COVID-19 progression stems from the high prevalence of the ehCoV and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. The question has been raised of whether therapeutic convalescent plasma or control plasma containing ehCoV antibodies might alter the outcome of COVID-19 progression to hospitalization. Here, we observed that plasma transfusion did not significantly change the preexisting ehCoV antibody levels. In over 50 hospitalized participants and 250 nonhospitalized participants, ehCoV antibody levels were comparable, without statistical differences. Antibody levels were stable over the more than 12&#x2009;months of the intervention trial, with individual heterogeneity similar in hospitalized and nonhospitalized participants. The ehCoV antibodies in plasma transfusion did not alter the recipient preexisting antibody levels nor hasten the COVID-19 progression to hospitalization in this clinical trial data.", "metadata": {"pmid": "36625657", "journal": "mBio", "mesh_terms": []}}

SARS-CoV-2 infection also elicits NF-&#x3ba;B signaling which regulates inflammatory cytokine expression contributing to viral control and likely disease severity. Few studies have simultaneously characterized these two components of innate immunity to COVID-19. We designed a study to characterize the expression of interferon alpha-2 ( IFNA2 ) and interferon beta-1 ( IFNB1 ), both type-1 interferons (IFN-1), interferon-gamma ( IFNG ), a type-2 interferon (IFN-2), ISGs, and NF-&#x3ba;B response genes in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of patients with mild (outpatient) versus severe (hospitalized) COVID-19. Further, we characterized the weekly dynamics of these responses in the upper and lower respiratory tracts (LRTs) and blood of severe patients to evaluate for compartmental differences. We observed significantly increased ISG and NF-&#x3ba;B responses in the URT of mild compared with severe patients early during illness. This pattern was associated with increased IFNA2 and IFNG expression in the URT of mild patients, a trend toward increased IFNB1 -expression and significantly increased STING/IRF3 /cGAS expression in the URT of severe patients. Our by-week across-compartment analysis in severe patients revealed significantly higher ISG responses in the blood compared with the URT and LRT of these patients during the first week of illness, despite significantly lower expression of IFNA2 , IFNB1 , and IFNG in blood. NF-&#x3ba;B responses, however, were significantly elevated in the LRT compared with the URT and blood of severe patients during peak illness (week 2).

Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was retrospectively determined against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during the periods of Delta and Omicron variants' predominance, separately, and was calculated based on a case-control study design. The humoral immune response, measured by a SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG titer, was prospectively assessed after the aforementioned vaccination schemes at different time points. This study showed higher effectiveness of BNT162b2 after two doses (81%) compared to two doses of Gam-COVID-Vac (41.8%) against the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, which correlated with anti-spike antibody levels. Regarding the Omicron variant, protection against infection and antibody levels were severely compromised and the correlation between an anti-spike IgG titer and effectiveness was lost, unlike the situation during the Delta wave. Considering the booster vaccination schemes, a homologous BNT162b2 booster after a BNT162b2 primary vaccination induced a higher humoral immune response when compared to that induced by a heterologous BNT162b2 booster after a Gam-COVID-Vac primary vaccination. However, the VE of both booster regimens against the Omicron variant was almost equal (64% in the homologous regimen and 57% in heterologous regimen).

Commercially available vaccines are typically studied in terms of influenza A H1 and H3 viruses but influenza B viruses need to be examined as well. Thus, there is a need to both understand the limitations of split/subunit vaccines and develop strategies to overcome those limitations, particularly their ability to elicit cross-reactive antibodies to the co-circulating Victoria (B-V) and Yamagata (B-Y) lineages of human influenza B viruses. In this study, we compared three commercial influenza hemagglutinin (HA) split/subunit vaccines, one quadrivalent (H1, H3, B-V, B-Y HAs) and two trivalent (H1, H3, B-V HAs), to characterize potential differences in their antibody responses and protection against a B-Y challenge. We found that the trivalent adjuvanted vaccine Fluad, formulated without B-Y HA, was able to produce antibodies to B-Y (cross-lineage) on a similar level to those elicited from a quadrivalent vaccine (Flucelvax) containing both B-V and B-Y HAs. Interestingly, Fluad protected mice from a lethal cross-lineage B-Y viral challenge, while another trivalent vaccine, Fluzone HD, failed to elicit antibodies or full protection following challenge. Fluad immunization also diminished viral burden in the lungs compared to Fluzone and saline groups. The success of a trivalent vaccine to provide protection from a cross-lineage influenza B challenge, similar to a quadrivalent vaccine, suggests that further analysis of different split/subunit vaccine formulations could identify mechanisms for vaccines to target antigenically different viruses. Understanding how to increase the breadth of the immune response following immunization will be needed for universal influenza vaccine development.", "metadata": {"pmid": "36248851", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "mesh_terms": []}}

Here, we examine the importance of N-myristoylation during vaccinia virus (VACV) infection in primate cells and demonstrate the anti-poxviral effects of IMP-1088. N-myristoylated proteins from VACV and the host were metabolically labelled with myristic acid alkyne during infection using quantitative chemical proteomics. We identified VACV proteins A16, G9 and L1 to be N-myristoylated. Treatment with NMT inhibitor IMP-1088 potently abrogated VACV infection, while VACV gene expression, DNA replication, morphogenesis and EV formation remained unaffected. Importantly, we observed that loss of N-myristoylation resulted in greatly reduced infectivity of assembled mature virus particles, characterized by significantly reduced host cell entry and a decline in membrane fusion activity of progeny virus. While the N-myristoylation of VACV entry proteins L1, A16 and G9 was inhibited by IMP-1088, mutational and genetic studies demonstrated that the N-myristoylation of L1 was the most critical for VACV entry. Given the significant genetic identity between VACV, monkeypox virus and variola virus L1 homologs, our data provides a basis for further investigating the role of N-myristoylation in poxviral infections as well as the potential of selective NMT inhibitors like IMP-1088 as broad-spectrum poxvirus inhibitors.", "metadata": {"pmid": "36215331", "journal": "PLoS pathogens", "mesh_terms": []}}

Heterologous sequential vaccination may be an effective approach for protecting against dengue, as this strategy would mimic the natural route to broad dengue protection and may overcome the imbalances in efficacy of the individual leading live attenuated dengue vaccines. Here we review 'mix and match' vaccination trials against SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and dengue virus and discuss the possible advantages and concerns of future heterologous immunization with the leading dengue vaccines. COVID-19 trials suggest that priming with a vaccine that induces strong cellular responses, such as an adenoviral vectored product, followed by heterologous boost may optimize T cell immunity. Moreover, heterologous vaccination may induce superior humoral immunity compared to homologous vaccination when the priming vaccine induces a narrower response than the boost. The HIV trials reported that heterologous vaccination was associated with broadened antigen responses and that the sequence of the vaccines significantly impacts the regimen's immunogenicity and efficacy. In heterologous dengue immunization trials, where at least one dose was with a live attenuated vaccine, all reported equivalent or increased immunogenicity compared to homologous boost, although one study reported increased reactogenicity. The three leading dengue vaccines have been evaluated for safety and efficacy in thousands of study participants but not in combination in heterologous dengue vaccine trials. Various heterologous regimens including different combinations and sequences should be trialed to optimize cellular and humoral immunity and the breadth of the response while limiting reactogenicity.

Undetected circulation combined with atypical transmission and case presentation, including mild and asymptomatic disease, have facilitated the spread of monkeypox in non-endemic regions. A broader availability of diagnostics, enhanced surveillance, and targeted education, combined with a better understanding of the routes of transmission, are critical to identify at-risk populations and design science-based countermeasures to control the current outbreak.", "metadata": {"pmid": "36146818", "journal": "Viruses", "mesh_terms": []}}

Here we addressed one criticism of the model, a requirement for a high-titer administration of virus, as well as improving our understanding of monkeypox virus pathogenesis. To do so, we infected macaques with a challenge dose containing a characterized inoculum enriched for the extracellular form of monkeypox virus. Although there were some differences between diseases caused by the enriched preparation compared with a relatively similar unpurified preparation, we were unable to reduce the viral input with the enriched preparation and maintain severe disease. We found that inherent factors contained within the serum of nonhuman primate blood affect the stability of the monkeypox extracellular virions.

Important components of a vaccine development plan for Animal Rule licensure are the identification of an immune correlate of protection and immunobridging to humans. The relationship of vaccine-induced immune responses to survival after vaccination and challenge must be established in validated animal models and then used to infer predictive vaccine efficacy in humans via immunobridging.

Methods: We performed aerosol testing as part of the biosafety evaluation of the MACSQuant Tyto, a completely closed, cartridge-based cell sorter. We also established quality control procedures to routinely evaluate instrument performance. Results: The MACSQuant Tyto does not produce aerosols as part of the sort procedure. Discussion: These data serve as guidance for other facilities with containment laboratories wishing to use the MACSQuant Tyto for cell sorting. Potential users should consult with their Institutional Biosafety Committees to perform in-house risk assessments of this equipment. Conclusion: The MACSQuant Tyto can safely be used on the benchtop to sort samples at BSL-3.", "metadata": {"pmid": "36034097", "journal": "Applied biosafety : journal of the American Biological Safety Association", "mesh_terms": []}}

Both VOCs displayed a confined window of detectable airborne virus (24-48 h), shorter than compared to oropharyngeal swabs. The loss of airborne shedding was linked to airway constriction resulting in a decrease of fine aerosols (1-10&#x3bc;m) produced, which are suspected to be the major driver of airborne transmission. Male sex was associated with increased viral replication and virus shedding in the air. Next, we compared the transmission efficiency of both variants and found no significant differences. Transmission efficiency varied mostly among donors, 0-100% (including a superspreading event), and aerosol transmission over multiple chain links was representative of natural heterogeneity of exposure dose and downstream viral kinetics. Co-infection with VOCs only occurred when both viruses were shed by the same donor during an increased exposure timeframe (24-48 h).

The virus gains access to host cells when the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to the host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Studies have attempted to understand SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interactions with vertebrate orthologs of ACE2 by expressing ACE2 orthologs in mammalian cells and measuring viral infection or S-protein binding. Often, these cells only transiently express ACE2 proteins, and the levels of ACE2 at the cell surface are not quantified. Here, we describe a cell-based assay that uses stably transfected cells expressing ACE2 proteins in a bicistronic vector with an easy-to-quantify reporter protein, Thy1.1. We found that both the binding of the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and infection with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus are proportional to the amount of human ACE2 expressed at the cell surface, which can be inferred by quantifying the level of Thy1.1. We also compared different ACE2 orthologs, which were expressed in stably transfected cells expressing equivalent levels of Thy1.1. When ranked for either viral infectivity or RBD binding, mouse ACE2 had a weak to undetectable affinity for S-protein, while human ACE2 had the highest level detected, and feline ACE2 had an intermediate phenotype. The generation of stably transfected cells whose ACE2 level can be normalized for cross-ortholog comparisons allows us to create a reusable cellular library useful for measuring emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants' abilities to potentially infect different animals. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus responsible for the worst global pandemic in a century. An understanding of how the virus can infect other vertebrate species is important for controlling viral spread and understanding the natural history of the virus. Here, we describe a method to generate cells stably expressing different orthologs of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, on the surface of a human cell line. We find that both the binding of the viral spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and infection of cells with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus are proportional to the ACE2 levels at the cell surface.

To evaluate the use of surveillance testing and quarantine in a fully vaccinated student population for whom vaccine effectiveness may be affected by the type of vaccination, presence of variants, and loss of vaccine-induced or natural immunity over time. In this simulation study, an agent-based Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered model was developed with some parameters estimated using data from the 2020 to 2021 academic year at Duke University (Durham, North Carolina) that described a simulated population of 5000 undergraduate students residing on campus in residential dormitories. This study assumed that 100% of residential undergraduates are vaccinated. Under varying levels of vaccine effectiveness (90%, 75%, and 50%), the reductions in the numbers of positive cases under various mitigation strategies that involved surveillance testing and quarantine were estimated. The percentage of students infected with SARS-CoV-2 each day for the course of the semester (100 days) and the total number of isolated or quarantined students were estimated. A total of 5000 undergraduates were simulated in the study. In simulations with 90% vaccine effectiveness, weekly surveillance testing was associated with only marginally reduced viral transmission. At 50% to 75% effectiveness, surveillance testing was estimated to reduce the number of infections by as much as 93.6%. A 10-day quarantine protocol for exposures was associated with only modest reduction in infections until vaccine effectiveness dropped to 50%. Increased testing of reported contacts was estimated to be at least as effective as quarantine at limiting infections. In this simulated modeling study of infection dynamics on a college campus where 100% of the student body is vaccinated, weekly surveillance testing was associated with a substantial reduction of campus infections with even a modest loss of vaccine effectiveness. Model simulations also suggested that an increased testing cadence can be as effective as a 10-day quarantine period at limiting infections.

The first episode was caused by the Pango lineage B.1.466.2 and resulted in severe COVID-19 with 5 days in an intensive care unit (ICU). The second episode occurred approximately 6 months later, during the Delta surge in Indonesia. Genomic analysis showed that the second infection was caused by the Delta variant (Pango lineage B.1.617.2) and resulted in mild disease that did not require hospitalization. No SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected between the two episodes, but both binding and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected prior to the reinfection, with the second infection leading to an increase in the levels of antibody. We confirmed that the patient experienced a reinfection instead of persistent viral shedding from the first infection based on epidemiological, clinical, serological, and genomic analyses.

Within weeks of the first report of B.1.1.529, this VoC has rapidly spread throughout the world, replacing previously circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 and leading to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases even in populations with high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity. Studies have shown that B.1.1.529 is less sensitive to protective antibody conferred by previous infections and vaccines developed against earlier lineages of SARS-CoV-2. The ability of B.1.1.529 to spread even among vaccinated populations has led to a global public health demand for updated vaccines that can confer protection against B.1.1.529. We rapidly developed a replicating RNA vaccine expressing the B.1.1.529 spike and evaluated immunogenicity in mice and hamsters. We also challenged hamsters with B.1.1.529 and evaluated whether vaccination could protect against viral shedding and replication within respiratory tissue. We found that mice previously immunized with A.1-specific vaccines failed to elevate neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.1.529 following B.1.1.529-targeted boosting, suggesting pre-existing immunity may impact the efficacy of B.1.1.529-targeted boosters. Furthermore, we found that our B.1.1.529-targeted vaccine provides superior protection compared to the ancestral A.1-targeted vaccine in hamsters challenged with the B.1.1.529 VoC after a single dose of each vaccine. Our data suggest that B.1.1.529-targeted vaccines may provide superior protection against B.1.1.529 but pre-existing immunity and timing of boosting may need to be considered for optimum protection.

To determine whether SARS-CoV-2's cellular tropism plays a critical role in severe pathophysiology in the lung, we investigated its host cell entry receptor distribution in the bronchial airway epithelium of healthy adults and high-risk adults (those with COPD). We found that SARS-CoV-2 preferentially infects goblet cells in the bronchial airway epithelium, as mostly goblet cells harbor the entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its cofactor transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). We also found that SARS-CoV-2 replication was substantially increased in the COPD bronchial airway epithelium, likely due to COPD-associated goblet cell hyperplasia. Likewise, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) infection increased disease pathophysiology (e.g., syncytium formation) in the COPD bronchial airway epithelium. Our results reveal that goblet cells play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2-induced pathophysiology in the lung. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19's first case was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and by March 2020 it was declared a pandemic by the WHO. It has been shown that various underlying conditions can increase the chance of having severe COVID-19. COPD, which is the third leading cause of death worldwide, is one of the conditions listed by the CDC which can increase the chance of severe COVID-19. The present study uses a healthy and COPD-derived bronchial airway epithelial model to study the COVID-19 and host factors which could explain the reason for COPD patients developing severe infection due to COVID-19.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35862971", "journal": "Microbiology spectrum", "mesh_terms": []}}

Having shown that each of the TCLs were antigen-specific and antigen-reactive, single cell mRNA analyses demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S and M proteins drive strikingly distinct molecular signatures. Whereas the S-specific CD4 + T cell transcriptional signature showed a marked upregulation of CCL1, CD44, IL17RB, TNFRSF18 (GITR) and IGLC3 genes, in general their overall transcriptome signature was more similar to CD4 + T cell responses induced by other viral antigens (e.g. CMV).

Besides their epidemiological importance, the observed SARS-CoV-2 sequences present an ensemble of viable protein variants, and thereby a source of information on viral protein structure and function. Charting the mutational landscape of the nucleocapsid (N) protein that facilitates viral assembly, we observe variability exceeding that of the spike protein, with more than 86% of residues that can be substituted, on average by three to four different amino acids. However, mutations exhibit an uneven distribution that tracks known structural features but also reveals highly protected stretches of unknown function. One of these conserved regions is in the central disordered linker proximal to the N-G215C mutation that has become dominant in the Delta variant, outcompeting G215 variants without further spike or N-protein substitutions. Structural models suggest that the G215C mutation stabilizes conserved transient helices in the disordered linker serving as protein-protein interaction interfaces. Comparing Delta variant N-protein to its ancestral version in biophysical experiments, we find a significantly more compact and less disordered structure. N-G215C exhibits substantially stronger self-association, shifting the unliganded protein from a dimeric to a tetrameric oligomeric state, which leads to enhanced coassembly with nucleic acids. This suggests that the sequence variability of N-protein is mirrored by high plasticity of N-protein biophysical properties, which we hypothesize can be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to achieve greater efficiency of viral assembly, and thereby enhanced infectivity.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35783502", "journal": "PNAS nexus", "mesh_terms": []}}

We used avian paramyxovirus type 3 (APMV3) as an intranasal vaccine vector to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. A lack of pre-existing immunity in humans and attenuation by host-range restriction make APMV3 a vector of interest. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein was stabilized in its prefusion conformation by six proline substitutions (S-6P) rather than the two that are used in most vaccine candidates, providing increased stability. APMV3 expressing S-6P (APMV3/S-6P) replicated to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs and was genetically stable, whereas APMV3 expressing non-stabilized S or S-2P were unstable. In hamsters, a single intranasal dose of APMV3/S-6P induced strong serum IgG and IgA responses to the S protein and its receptor-binding domain, and strong serum neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 isolate WA1/2020 (lineage A). Sera from APMV3/S-6P-immunized hamsters also efficiently neutralized Alpha and Beta variants of concern. Immunized hamsters challenged with WA1/2020 did not exhibit the weight loss and lung inflammation observed in empty-vector-immunized controls; SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of immunized animals was low or undetectable compared to the substantial replication in controls. Thus, a single intranasal dose of APMV3/S-6P was highly immunogenic and protective against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, suggesting that APMV3/S-6P is suitable for clinical development.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35764659", "journal": "NPJ vaccines", "mesh_terms": []}}

Here we used unbiased approaches to longitudinally dissect primary antibody, plasmablast, and memory B cell (MBC) responses to the two-dose mRNA-1273 vaccine in SARS-CoV-2-naive adults. Coordinated immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibody responses were preceded by bursts of spike-specific plasmablasts after both doses but earlier and more intensely after dose 2. While antibody and B cell cellular responses were generally robust, they also varied within the cohort and decreased over time after a dose-2 peak. Both antigen-nonspecific postvaccination plasmablast frequency after dose 1 and their spike-specific counterparts early after dose 2 correlated with subsequent antibody levels. This correlation between early plasmablasts and antibodies remained for titers measured at 6 months after vaccination. Several distinct antigen-specific MBC populations emerged postvaccination with varying kinetics, including two MBC populations that correlated with 2- and 6-month antibody titers. Both were IgG-expressing MBCs: one less mature, appearing as a correlate after the first dose, while the other MBC correlate showed a more mature and resting phenotype, emerging as a correlate later after dose 2. This latter MBC was also a major contributor to the sustained spike-specific MBC response observed at month 6.

Following ART, serum levels of ketone bodies, carnitine, and amino acid metabolism were normalized, however glycolysis, PPP, lactate production, and &#x3b2;-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids remained abnormal. Our findings suggest that HIV infection is associated with an increased immunometabolic demand that is satisfied through the utilization of alternative energetic substrates, including fatty acids and amino acids.

A portable virus capture device, coupled with label-free Raman spectroscopy, holds the promise of fast detection by rapidly obtaining the Raman signature of a virus followed by a machine learning (ML) approach applied to recognize the virus based on its Raman spectrum, which is used as a fingerprint. We present such an ML approach for analyzing Raman spectra of human and avian viruses. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier specifically designed for spectral data achieves very high accuracy for a variety of virus type or subtype identification tasks. In particular, it achieves 99% accuracy for classifying influenza virus type A versus type B, 96% accuracy for classifying four subtypes of influenza A, 95% accuracy for differentiating enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, and 99% accuracy for differentiating avian coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus [IBV]) from other avian viruses. Furthermore, interpretation of neural net responses in the trained CNN model using a full-gradient algorithm highlights Raman spectral ranges that are most important to virus identification. By correlating ML-selected salient Raman ranges with the signature ranges of known biomolecules and chemical functional groups&#x2014;for example, amide, amino acid, and carboxylic acid&#x2014;we verify that our ML model effectively recognizes the Raman signatures of proteins, lipids, and other vital functional groups present in different viruses and uses a weighted combination of these signatures to identify viruses.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35653572", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "mesh_terms": []}}

However, it is less clear that vaccine-induced immunity is able to limit infection-elicited inflammation in the lower respiratory tract. To assess this, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples after SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 challenge from rhesus macaques vaccinated with mRNA-1273 in a dose-reduction study. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling revealed a broad cellular landscape 48 hours after challenge, with distinct inflammatory signatures that correlated with viral RNA burden in the lower respiratory tract. These inflammatory signatures included phagocyte-restricted expression of chemokines, such as CXCL10 and CCL3, and the broad expression of IFN-induced genes, such as MX1, ISG15, and IFIT1. Induction of these inflammatory profiles was suppressed by prior mRNA-1273 vaccination in a dose-dependent manner and negatively correlated with prechallenge serum and lung antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike. These observations were replicated and validated in a second independent macaque challenge study using the B.1.351/Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2.

In this randomised, double-blind, double placebo-controlled trial, patients were enrolled at 67 trial sites in the USA (60 sites), South Korea (two sites), Mexico (two sites), Singapore (two sites), and Japan (one site). Hospitalised adults (&#x2265;18 years) with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen administered by low-flow (&#x2264;15 L/min), high-flow (&gt;15 L/min), or non-invasive mechanical ventilation modalities who met the study eligibility criteria (male or non-pregnant female adults &#x2265;18 years old with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either baricitinib, remdesivir, and placebo, or dexamethasone, remdesivir, and placebo using a permuted block design. Randomisation was stratified by study site and baseline ordinal score at enrolment. All patients received remdesivir (&#x2264;10 days) and either baricitinib (or matching oral placebo) for a maximum of 14 days or dexamethasone (or matching intravenous placebo) for a maximum of 10 days.

However, viral load in Ebola virus disease is currently estimated using numerous different assays and protocols that were not developed or validated for this purpose. Here, our aim was to conduct a laboratory-based re-evaluation of the viral loads of a large cohort of Liberian patients with Ebola virus disease and analyse these data in the broader context of the west Africa epidemic. In this retrospective observational study, whole blood samples from patients at the Eternal Love Winning Africa Ebola treatment unit (Monrovia, Liberia) were re-extracted with an optimised protocol and analysed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) using a novel semi-strand specific assay to measure viral load. To allow for more direct comparisons, the ddPCR viral loads were also back-calculated to cycle threshold (C t ) values. The new viral load data were then compared with the C t values from the original diagnostic quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) testing to identify differing trends and discrepancies. Between Aug 28 and Dec 18, 2014, 727 whole blood samples from 528 individuals were collected. 463 (64%) were first-draw samples and 409 (56%) were from patients positive for Ebola virus (EBOV), species Zaire ebolavirus. Of the 307 first-draw EBOV-positive samples, 127 (41%) were from survivors and 180 (59%) were from non-survivors; 155 (50%) were women, 145 (47%) were men, and seven (2%) were not recorded, and the mean age was 29&#xb7;3 (SD 15&#xb7;0) years for women and 31&#xb7;8 (SD 14&#xb7;8) years for men. Survivors had significantly lower mean viral loads at presentation than non-survivors in both the reanalysed dataset (5&#xb7;61 [95% CI 5&#xb7;34-5&#xb7;87] vs 7&#xb7;19 [6&#xb7;99-7&#xb7;38] log 10 EBOV RNA copies per mL; p&lt;0&#xb7;0001) and diagnostic dataset (C t value 28&#xb7;72 [27&#xb7;97-29&#xb7;47] vs 26&#xb7;26 [25&#xb7;72-26&#xb7;81]; p&lt;0&#xb7;0001). However, the prognostic capacity of viral load increased with the reanalysed dataset (odds ratio [OR] of death 8&#xb7;06 [95% CI 4&#xb7;81-13&#xb7;53], p&lt;0&#xb7;0001 for viral loads above 6&#xb7;71 log 10 EBOV RNA copies per mL vs OR of death 2&#xb7;02 [1&#xb7;27-3&#xb7;20], p=0&#xb7;0028 for C t values below 27&#xb7;37). Diagnostic qRT-PCR significantly (p&lt;0&#xb7;0001) underestimated viral load in both survivors and non-survivors (difference in diagnostic C t value minus laboratory C t value of 1&#xb7;79 [95% CI 1&#xb7;16-2&#xb7;43] for survivors and 5&#xb7;15 [4&#xb7;43-5&#xb7;87] for non-survivors). Six samples that were reported negative by diagnostic testing were found to be positive upon reanalysis and had high viral loads. Inaccurate viral load estimation from diagnostic C t values is probably multifactorial; however, unaddressed PCR inhibition from tissue damage in patients with fulminant Ebola virus disease could largely account for the discrepancies observed in our study. Testing protocols for Ebola virus disease require further standardisation and validation to produce accurate viral load estimates, minimise false negatives, and allow for reliable epidemiological investigation.

Some of these variants show increased resistance to vaccine-elicited immunity, convalescent plasma, or monoclonal antibodies. In particular, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike have drawn attention. To facilitate the isolation of neutralizing antibodies and the monitoring of vaccine effectiveness against these variants, we designed and produced biotin-labeled molecular probes of variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes and their subdomains, using a structure-based construct design that incorporated an N-terminal purification tag, a specific amino acid sequence for protease cleavage, the variant spike-based region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. These probes could be produced by a single step using in-process biotinylation and purification. We characterized the physical properties and antigenicity of these probes, comprising the N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the RBD and subdomain 1 (RBD-SD1), and the prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain (S2P) with sequences from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or of interest, including variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron. We functionally validated probes by using yeast expressing a panel of nine SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibodies and confirmed sorting capabilities of variant probes using yeast displaying libraries of plasma antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent donors. We deposited these constructs to Addgene to enable their dissemination.

Between June 17, 2015, and June 30, 2017, we studied a cohort of Ebola virus disease survivors and their contacts in Liberia. Surveys, current symptoms and physical examination findings, and serology were used to characterise disease status of reported Ebola virus disease, unrecognised Ebola virus disease, pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic Ebola virus infection, or no infection. We pre-specified findings known to be differentially prevalent among Ebola virus disease survivors versus their contacts (urinary frequency, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, memory loss, joint pain, neurological findings, chest findings, muscle findings, joint findings, abdominal findings, and uveitis). We estimated the prevalence and incidence of selected clinical findings by disease status. Our analytical cohort included 991 reported Ebola virus disease survivors and 2688 close contacts. The median time from acute Ebola virus disease onset to baseline was 317 days (IQR 271-366). Of 222 seropositive contacts, 115 had pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic Ebola virus infection and 107 had unrecognised Ebola virus disease.

Methods: We used pooled data from three clinical trials of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to compare: 1 ) the hospital discharge approach; 2 ) the TICO (Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19) trials sustained recovery approach; and 3 ) a comprehensive approach. At the time of enrollment, all patients were hospitalized in a non-ICU setting without organ failure or major extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. We defined discordance as a difference between time to recovery. Measurements and Main Results: Discordance between the hospital discharge and comprehensive approaches occurred in 170 (20%) of 850 enrolled participants, including 126 hospital readmissions and 24 deaths after initial hospital discharge. Discordant participants were older (median age, 68 vs. 59 years; P &#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and more had a comorbidity (84% vs. 70%; P &#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

We assessed monthly seroprevalence compared to the statewide estimated number of cases and proportion of positive test results (testing positivity). We used Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of demographic characteristics, homelessness, and manner of death with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 1906 decedents, 305 (16%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Monthly seroprevalence increased from 11% to 22% over time and was consistently higher than state-level estimates of testing positivity. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with 2- to 3.2-fold higher seropositivity ( P &#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.05) irrespective of sex. Deaths due to motor vehicle crash were associated with 62% increased seropositivity (aPR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.15-2.28]) vs natural manner of death. Though seroprevalence was lower in decedents of illicit drug overdose vs nonoverdose in early months, this shifted, and seroprevalence was comparable by November 2020. Decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination, especially those dying due to motor vehicle trauma, may be a sentinel population for COVID-19 spread in the general population and merits exploration in other states/regions.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35415200", "journal": "Open forum infectious diseases", "mesh_terms": []}}

However, it is unknown whether macaque antibody responses resemble the response in humans. To answer this question, we employed a phage-based deep mutational scanning approach (Phage-DMS) to compare which linear epitopes are targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in convalescent humans, convalescent (re-infected) rhesus macaques, mRNA-vaccinated humans, and repRNA-vaccinated pigtail macaques. We also used Phage-DMS to determine antibody escape pathways within each epitope, enabling a granular comparison of antibody binding specificities at the locus level. Overall, we identified some common epitope targets in both macaques and humans, including in the fusion peptide (FP) and stem helix-heptad repeat 2 (SH-H) regions. Differences between groups included a response to epitopes in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) in vaccinated humans but not vaccinated macaques, as well as recognition of a CTD epitope and epitopes flanking the FP in convalescent macaques but not convalescent humans. There was also considerable variability in the escape pathways among individuals within each group. Sera from convalescent macaques showed the least variability in escape overall and converged on a common response with vaccinated humans in the SH-H epitope region, suggesting highly similar antibodies were elicited. Collectively, these findings suggest that the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in macaques shares many features with humans, but with substantial differences in the recognition of certain epitopes and considerable individual variability in antibody escape profiles, suggesting a diverse repertoire of antibodies that can respond to major epitopes in both humans and macaques. Differences in macaque species and exposure type may also contribute to these findings.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35404959", "journal": "PLoS pathogens", "mesh_terms": []}}

Dynamic [18F]-DPA-714 PET/computed tomography imaging was performed longitudinally at baseline and at multiple time points after EBOV inoculation, and distribution volumes (Vt) were calculated as a measure of peripheral TSPO binding. Using a mixed-effect linear regression model, spleen and lung Vt decreased, while the bone marrow Vt increased over time after infection. No clear trend was found for liver Vt. Multiple plasma cytokines correlated negatively with lung/spleen Vt and positively with bone marrow Vt. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining in spleen and lung sections confirmed organ-level lymphoid and monocytic loss/apoptosis, thus validating the imaging results. Our findings are consistent with EBOV-induced progressive monocytic and lymphocytic depletion in the spleen, rather than immune activation, as well as depletion of alveolar macrophages in the lungs, with inefficient reactive neutrophilic activation. Increased bone marrow Vt, on the other hand, suggests hematopoietic activation in response to systemic immune cell depletion and leukocytosis and could have prognostic relevance.

Based on dilution series in cell culture medium, an approximate limit of detection for each variant was determined. The OraSure InteliSwab &#x2122; Test showed an overall comparable performance using recombinant nucleocapsid protein and different cultured variants, with recorded limits of detection ranging between 3.77 &#xd7; 10 5 and 9.13 &#xd7; 10 5 RNA copies/mL. Finally, the sensitivity was evaluated using oropharyngeal swabs from Syrian golden hamsters inoculated with the six VOCs.

It is imperative to show protection against VOC infection with newly developed vaccines. Previously, we evaluated two vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone (VSV-SARS2) or in combination with the Ebola virus glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV) and demonstrated their fast-acting potential. Here, we prolonged the time to challenge; we vaccinated hamsters intranasally (IN) or intramuscularly 28 days prior to infection with three SARS-CoV-2 VOC-the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants. IN vaccination with either the VSV-SARS2 or VSV-SARS2-EBOV resulted in the highest protective efficacy as demonstrated by decreased virus shedding and lung viral load of vaccinated hamsters. Histopathologic analysis of the lungs revealed the least amount of lung damage in the IN-vaccinated animals regardless of the challenge virus.

A potential risk of ADE in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has also been discussed since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, clinical evidence of the presence of antibodies with ADE potential is limited. Here, we show that ADE antibodies are produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ADE process can be mediated by at least two different host factors, Fc&#x3b3; receptor (Fc&#x3b3;R) and complement component C1q. Of 89 serum samples collected from acute or convalescent COVID-19 patients, 62.9% were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG. Fc&#x3b3;R- and/or C1q-mediated ADE were detected in 50% of the IgG-positive sera, whereas most of them showed neutralizing activity in the absence of Fc&#x3b3;R and C1q. Importantly, ADE antibodies were found in 41.4% of the acute COVID-19 patients. Neutralizing activity was also detected in most of the IgG-positive sera, but it was counteracted by ADE in subneutralizing conditions in the presence of Fc&#x3b3;R or C1q. Although the clinical importance of ADE needs to be further investigated with larger numbers of COVID-19 patient samples, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes multiple mechanisms of ADE. C1q-mediated ADE may particularly have a clinical impact since C1q is present at high concentrations in plasma and its receptors are ubiquitously expressed on the surfaces of many types of cells, including respiratory epithelial cells, which SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects. IMPORTANCE Potential risks of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been discussed and the proposed mechanism mostly depends on the Fc gamma receptor (Fc&#x3b3;R). However, since Fc&#x3b3;Rs are exclusively expressed on immune cells, which are not primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, the clinical importance of ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains controversial. Our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces antibodies that increase SARS-CoV-2 infection through another ADE mechanism in which complement component C1q mediates the enhancement. Although neutralizing activity was also detected in the serum samples, it was counteracted by ADE in the presence of Fc&#x3b3;R or C1q. Considering the ubiquity of C1q and its cellular receptors, C1q-mediated ADE may more likely occur in respiratory epithelial cells, which SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects. Our data highlight the importance of careful monitoring of the antibody properties in COVID-19 convalescent and vaccinated individuals.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35319248", "journal": "Microbiology spectrum", "mesh_terms": []}}

Increased levels of circulating neurofilament light chain (NfL), a biomarker of neuronal injury, have been observed in severe COVID-19 patients. We investigated whether NfL provides non-redundant clinical value to previously identified predictors of COVID-19 mortality. We measured serum or plasma NfL concentrations in a blinded fashion in 3 cohorts totaling 338 COVID-19 patients. In cohort 1, we found significantly elevated NfL levels only in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal cohort 2 data showed that NfL is elevated late in the course of the disease, following the two other prognostic markers of COVID-19: decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Significant correlations between ALC and LDH abnormalities and subsequent rise of NfL implicate that the multi-organ failure is the most likely cause of neuronal injury in severe COVID-19 patients. The addition of NfL to age and gender in cohort 1 significantly improved the accuracy of mortality prediction and these improvements were validated in cohorts 2 and 3. A substantial increase in serum/plasma NfL reproducibly enhanced COVID-19 mortality prediction. Combined with other prognostic markers, such as ALC and LDH that are routinely measured in ICU patients, NfL measurements might be useful to identify the patients at a high risk of COVID-19-associated mortality, who might still benefit from escalated care.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35313387", "journal": "Annals of clinical and translational neurology", "mesh_terms": []}}

The antibody neutralisation titres against SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 strain were comparable between post-partum and non-post-partum women and these levels were sustained up to four months post-second vaccination in both groups.

Elevated responses, particularly to the &#x3b2;-CoV OC43, were observed in all natural infection cohorts tested and were correlated with the response to SARS-CoV-2. The kinetics of this response and isotypes involved suggest that infection boosts preexisting antibody lineages raised against prior endemic CoV exposure that cross-react. While further research is needed to discern whether this recalled response is desirable or detrimental, the boosted antibodies principally targeted the better-conserved S2 subdomain of the viral spike and were not associated with neutralization activity. In contrast, vaccination with a stabilized spike mRNA vaccine did not robustly boost cross-reactive antibodies, suggesting differing antigenicity and immunogenicity. In sum, this study provides evidence that antibodies targeting endemic CoV are robustly boosted in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection but not to vaccination with stabilized S, and that depending on conformation or other factors, the S2 subdomain of the spike protein triggers a rapidly recalled, IgG-dominated response that lacks neutralization activity.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35289271", "journal": "eLife", "mesh_terms": []}}

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from PCR-confirmed, recovered COVID-19 convalescent individuals ( n &#x2009;=&#x2009;30) infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States collected in April and May 2020 who possessed at least one or more of six different HLA haplotypes were selected for examination of their anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8 + T-cell responses using a multiplexed peptide-major histocompatibility complex tetramer staining approach. This analysis examined if the previously identified viral epitopes targeted by CD8 + T cells in these individuals ( n &#x2009;=&#x2009;52 distinct epitopes) are mutated in the newly described Omicron VOC ( n &#x2009;=&#x2009;50 mutations). Within this population, only one low-prevalence epitope from the Spike protein, restricted to two HLA alleles and found in 2/30 (7%) individuals, contained a single amino acid change associated with the Omicron VOC. These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8 + T-cell responses should recognize the Omicron VOC and that SARS-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this time. IMPORTANCE The newly identified Omicron variant of concern contains more mutations than any of the previous variants described to date. In addition, many of the mutations associated with the Omicron variant are found in areas that are likely bound by neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the first line of immunological defense against COVID-19 is compromised. However, both natural infection and vaccination develop T-cell-based responses in addition to antibodies. This study examined if the parts of the virus, or epitopes, targeted by the CD8 + T-cell response in 30 individuals who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 were mutated in the Omicron variant. Only one of 52 epitopes identified in this population contained an amino acid that was mutated in Omicron.

It has been challenging to disentangle how population-level patterns of humoral immunity change as a function of age, calendar year, and birth cohort from cross-sectional data alone. We analyzed 1,589 longitudinal sera samples from 260 children across three studies in Nicaragua, 2006-16. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers were determined against four H3N2 strains, one H1N1 strain, and two H1N1pdm strains. We assessed temporal patterns of HAI titers using an age-period-cohort modeling framework. We found that titers against a given virus depended on calendar year of serum collection and birth cohort but not on age. Titer cohort patterns were better described by participants' ages relative to year of likely introduction of the virus's antigenic cluster than by age relative to year of strain introduction or by year of birth. These cohort effects may be driven by a decreasing likelihood of early-life infection after cluster introduction and by more broadly reactive antibodies at a young age. H3N2 and H1N1 viruses had qualitatively distinct cohort patterns, with cohort patterns of titers to specific H3N2 strains reaching their peak in children born 3 years prior to that virus's antigenic cluster introduction and with titers to H1N1 and H1N1pdm strains peaking for children born 1-2 years prior to cluster introduction but not being dramatically lower for older children.

The emergence of SARS-CoV2 variants of concern (VoCs) and evidence that existing vaccines that were designed to protect from the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 may have reduced potency for protection from infection against these VoC is driving continued development of second-generation vaccines that can protect against multiple VoC. In this report, we evaluated an alphavirus-based replicating RNA vaccine expressing Spike proteins from the original SARS-CoV-2 Alpha strain and recent VoCs delivered in vivo via a lipid inorganic nanoparticle. Vaccination of both mice and Syrian Golden hamsters showed that vaccination induced potent neutralizing titers against each homologous VoC but reduced neutralization against heterologous challenges. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with homologous SARS-CoV2 variants exhibited complete protection from infection. In addition, vaccinated hamsters challenged with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibited significantly reduced shedding of infectious virus. Our data demonstrate that this vaccine platform can be updated to target emergent VoCs, elicits significant protective immunity against SARS-CoV2 variants and supports continued development of this platform. Since 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread worldwide and caused hundreds of millions of cases of COVID-19. Vaccines were rapidly developed to protect people from becoming severely ill from the virus and decrease the risk of death. However, new variants &#x2013; such as Alpha, Beta and Omicron &#x2013; have emerged that the vaccines do not work as well against, contributing to the ongoing spread of the virus. One way to overcome this is to create a vaccine that can be quickly and easily updated to target new variants, like the vaccine against influenza. Many of the vaccines made against COVID-19 use a new technology to introduce the RNA sequence of the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 into our cells. Once injected, our cells use their own machinery to build the protein, or &#x2018;antigen&#x2019;, so the immune system can learn how to recognize and destroy the virus. Here, Hawman et al. have renovated an RNA vaccine they made in 2020 which provides immunity against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 in monkeys and mice. In the newer versions of the vaccine, the RNA was updated with a sequence that matches the spike protein on the Beta or Alpha variant of the virus. Both the original and updated vaccines were then administered to mice and hamsters to see how well they worked against SARS-CoV-2 infections. The experiment showed that all three vaccines caused the animals to produce antibodies that can neutralize the original, Alpha and Beta strains of the virus . Vaccinated hamsters were then infected with one of the three variants &#x2013; either matched or mismatched to their vaccination &#x2013; to see how much protection each vaccine provided. All the vaccines reduced the amount of virus in the animals after infection and mitigated damage in their lungs. But animals that received a vaccine which corresponded to the SARS-CoV-2 strain they were infected with had slightly better protection. These findings suggest that these vaccines work best when their RNA sequence matches the strain responsible for the infection; however, even non-matched vaccines still provide a decent degree of protection. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that the vaccine platform created by Hawman et al. can be easily updated to target new strains of SARS-CoV-2 that may emerge in the future. Recently, the Beta variant of the vaccine entered clinical trials in the United States (led by HDT Bio) to evaluate whether it can be used as a booster in previously vaccinated individuals as well as unvaccinated participants.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35191378", "journal": "eLife", "mesh_terms": []}}

Besides their epidemiological importance, the observed SARS-CoV-2 sequences present an ensemble of viable protein variants, and thereby a source of information on viral protein structure and function. Charting the mutational landscape of the nucleocapsid (N) protein that facilitates viral assembly, we observe variability exceeding that of the spike protein, with more than 86% of residues that can be substituted, on average by 3-4 different amino acids. However, mutations exhibit an uneven distribution that tracks known structural features but also reveals highly protected stretches of unknown function. One of these conserved regions is in the central disordered linker proximal to the N-G215C mutation that has become dominant in the Delta variant, outcompeting G215 variants without further spike or N-protein substitutions. Structural models suggest that the G215C mutation stabilizes conserved transient helices in the disordered linker serving as protein-protein interaction interfaces. Comparing Delta variant N-protein to its ancestral version in biophysical experiments, we find a significantly more compact and less disordered structure. N-G215C exhibits substantially stronger self-association, shifting the unliganded protein from a dimeric to a tetrameric oligomeric state, which leads to enhanced co-assembly with nucleic acids.

In early January 2021, a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages, B.1.427 and B.1.429, was originally detected in California (CA) and it was shown to have enhanced infectivity in vitro and decreased antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence, transmissibility, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both variants exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1 (614G), with B.1.429 causing the most marked body weight loss among the 3 variants. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1. (614G) and B.1.427 infections. In addition, subgenomic viral RNA (sgRNA) levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429, however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three variants. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1 (614G) or B.1.427 in the oropharynx but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments, we found that B.1. (614G), epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) and gamma (P.1) dramatically outcompete alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351) and zeta (P.2) in the lungs. In the nasal cavity, B.1. (614G), gamma, and epsilon dominate, but the highly infectious alpha variant also maintains a moderate size niche. We did not observe significant differences in airborne transmission efficiency among the B.1.427, B.1.429 and ancestral B.1 (614G) and WA-1 variants in hamsters.

In contrast to rhesus macaques that survived Ebola virus (EBOV) exposure in the absence of treatment, we discovered that EBOV, despite being cleared from all other organs, persisted in the brain ventricular system of rhesus macaque survivors that had received monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. In mAb-treated macaque survivors, EBOV persisted in macrophages infiltrating the brain ventricular system, including the choroid plexuses. This macrophage infiltration was accompanied by severe tissue damage, including ventriculitis, choroid plexitis, and meningoencephalitis. Specifically, choroid plexus endothelium-derived EBOV infection led to viral persistence in the macaque brain ventricular system. This resulted in apoptosis of ependymal cells, which constitute the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the choroid plexuses. Fatal brain-confined recrudescence of EBOV infection manifested as severe inflammation, local pathology, and widespread infection of the ventricular system and adjacent neuropil in some of the mAb-treated macaque survivors.

H2N2 influenza virus circulated 50 years ago and represents a pandemic threat due to the lack of widespread immunity, but, unlike H1 and H5, the H2 HA stem contains Phe45 HA2 predicted to sterically clash with HA stem-binding antibodies characterized to date. To understand the effect of Phe45 HA2 , we compared the HA stem-specific B cell response in post hoc analyses of two phase 1 clinical trials, one testing vaccination with an H2 ferritin nanoparticle immunogen ( NCT03186781 ) and one with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine ( NCT01086657 ). In H2-naive individuals, the magnitude of the B cell response was equivalent, but H2-elicited HA stem-binding B cells displayed greater cross-reactivity than those elicited by H5. However, in individuals with childhood H2 exposure, H5-elicited HA stem-binding B cells also displayed high cross-reactivity, suggesting recall of memory B cells formed 50 years ago.

This study aimed to determine if prevaccination cytokine levels are associated with antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. A cross-sectional study was performed among 58 SOTRs before and after two-dose mRNA vaccine series, 35 additional SOTRs before and after a third vaccine dose, and comparison to 16 healthy controls (HCs). Antispike antibody was assessed using the IgG Euroimmun ELISA. Electrochemiluminescence detection-based multiplexed sandwich immunoassays (Meso Scale Diagnostics) were used to quantify plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations (n = 20 analytes) and compare concentrations between SOTRs and HCs, stratified by ultimate antibody response to the vaccine using Wilcoxon-rank-sum test with false discovery rates computed to correct for multiple comparisons. In the study population, 100% of HCs, 59% of SOTRs after 2 doses and 63% of SOTRs after 3 doses had a detectable antibody response. Multiple baseline cytokines were elevated in SOTRs versus HCs. There was no significant difference in baseline cytokine levels between SOTRs with high versus low-titer antibodies after 2 doses of vaccine. However, as compared with poor antibody responders, SOTRs who went on to develop a high-titer antibody response to a third dose of vaccine had significantly higher prethird dose levels of several innate immune cytokines including IL-17, IL-2Ra, IL-6, IP-10, MIP-1&#x3b1;, and TNF-&#x3b1; (false discovery rates &lt; 0.05).

In this phase 1-2, open-label clinical trial conducted at 10 sites in the United States, adults who had completed a Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier and had no reported history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines: mRNA-1273 (Moderna) at a dose of 100 &#x3bc;g, Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson &amp; Johnson-Janssen) at a dose of 5&#xd7;10 10 virus particles, or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) at a dose of 30 &#x3bc;g. The primary end points were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on trial days 15 and 29. Of the 458 participants who were enrolled in the trial, 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.COV2.S, and 153 received BNT162b2 as booster vaccines; 1 participant did not receive the assigned vaccine. Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. More than half the recipients reported having injection-site pain, malaise, headache, or myalgia. For all combinations, antibody neutralizing titers against a SARS-CoV-2 D614G pseudovirus increased by a factor of 4 to 73, and binding titers increased by a factor of 5 to 55.

Early following infection, SARS-CoV-2 replicated to high titers within the lungs and evaded triggering inflammation and cell death. However, a significant necrotic cell death event in CD45- populations, corresponding with peak viral loads, was observed on day 2 after infection. Metabolic reprogramming and inflammation were initiated following this cell death event and corresponded with increased lung interstitial pneumonia, perivascular inflammation, and endothelial hyperplasia together with decreased oxygen saturation. Therapeutic treatment with the RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1 improved survival in infected mice and limited inflammation and associated perivascular pathology.

Increased levels of circulating neurofilament light chain (NfL), a biomarker of neuro-axonal injury, have been observed in patients with severe COVID-19. We investigated whether NfL provides non-redundant clinical value to previously identified predictors of COVID-19 mortality. We measured serum or plasma NfL concentrations in a blinded fashion in 3 cohorts totaling 338 COVID-19 patients. In cohort 1, we found significantly elevated NfL levels only in critically ill COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Longitudinal cohort 2 data showed that NfL is elevated late in the course of the disease, following two other prognostic markers of COVID-19: decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Significant correlations between LDH and ALC abnormalities and subsequent rise of NfL implicate multi-organ failure as a likely cause of neuronal injury at the later stages of COVID-19. Addition of NfL to age and gender in cohort 1 significantly improved the accuracy of mortality prediction and these improvements were validated in cohorts 2 and 3. In conclusion, although substantial increase in serum/plasma NfL reproducibly enhances COVID-19 mortality prediction, NfL has clinically meaningful prognostic value only close to death, which may be too late to alter medical management. When combined with other prognostic biomarkers, rising longitudinal NfL measurements triggered by LDH and ALC abnormalities would identify patients at risk of COVID-19 associated mortality who might still benefit from escalated care.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35075461", "journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "mesh_terms": []}}

Using this setup, we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission between the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and lineage A in Syrian hamsters. Aerosol transmission of both variants was confirmed in all sentinels after 24&#x2009;h of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory virus shedding and seroconversion. Productive transmission also occurred after 1&#x2009;h of exposure, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, after donors were infected with a mix of both variants, the Alpha variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain. Overall, these data indicate that a lower infectious dose of the Alpha variant, compared to lineage A, could be sufficient for successful transmission. This highlights the continuous need to assess emerging variants and the development for pre-emptive transmission mitigation strategies.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35017676", "journal": "Nature microbiology", "mesh_terms": []}}

With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a single-dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10&#x2009;days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (i.n.) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to results for control animals. While both i.m. and i.n. vaccination induced neutralizing antibody titers, only i.m. vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of i.m. vaccinated animals only. Overall, the data demonstrate that VSV-SARS2-EBOV is a potent single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate that offers rapid protection based on the protective efficacy observed in our study. IMPORTANCE The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vaccine platform rose to fame in 2019, when a VSV-based Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human use against the deadly disease. Here, we demonstrate the protective efficacy of a VSV-EBOV-based COVID-19 vaccine against challenge in nonhuman primates (NHPs). When a single dose of the VSV-SARS2-EBOV vaccine was administered intramuscularly (i.m.), the NHPs were protected from COVID-19 within 10&#x2009;days. In contrast, if the vaccine was administered intranasally, there was no benefit from the vaccine and the NHPs developed pneumonia. The i.m. vaccinated NHPs quickly developed antigen-specific IgG, including neutralizing antibodies. Transcriptional analysis highlighted the development of protective innate and adaptive immune responses in the i.m. vaccination group only.", "metadata": {"pmid": "35012339", "journal": "mBio", "mesh_terms": []}}

We developed a novel, fluorescently labeled, antibody-based in vivo probe system using the anti-spike monoclonal antibody CR3022 and demonstrated that it could successfully identify sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rhesus macaque model of COVID-19. Our results showed that the fluorescent signal from our antibody-based probe could differentiate whole lungs of macaques infected for 9 days from those infected for 2 or 3 days.

To address this concern, we measured neutralizing antibodies against Omicron in three important settings: (1) post-vaccination sera after two and three immunizations with the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine, (2) convalescent sera from unvaccinated individuals infected by different variants, and (3) clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies. Using a pseudovirus neutralization assay, we found that titers against Omicron were low or undetectable after two immunizations and in most convalescent sera. A booster vaccination significantly increased titers against Omicron to levels comparable to those seen against the ancestral (D614G) variant after two immunizations. Neither age nor sex were associated with differences in post-vaccination antibody responses. Only three of 24 therapeutic antibodies tested retained their full potency against Omicron and high-level resistance was seen against fifteen. These findings underscore the potential benefit of booster mRNA vaccines for protection against Omicron and the need for additional therapeutic antibodies that are more robust to highly mutated variants. Third dose of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine significantly boosts neutralizing antibodies to the Omicron variant compared to a second dose, while neutralization of Omicron by convalescent sera, two-dose vaccine-elicited sera, or therapeutic antibodies is variable and often low.", "metadata": {"pmid": "34981057", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "mesh_terms": []}}

Of great concern is its high number of mutations, including 30-40 mutations in the virus spike (S) protein compared to 7-10 for other variants. Some of these mutations have been shown to enhance escape from vaccine-induced immunity, while others remain uncharacterized. Additionally, reports of increasing frequencies of the Omicron variant may indicate a higher rate of transmission compared to other variants. However, the transmissibility of Omicron and its degree of resistance to vaccine-induced immunity remain unclear. Here we show that Omicron exhibits significant immune evasion compared to other variants, but antibody neutralization is largely restored by mRNA vaccine booster doses. Additionally, the Omicron spike exhibits reduced receptor binding, cell-cell fusion, S1 subunit shedding, but increased cell-to-cell transmission, and homology modeling indicates a more stable closed S structure. These findings suggest dual immune evasion strategies for Omicron, due to altered epitopes and reduced exposure of the S receptor binding domain, coupled with enhanced transmissibility due to enhanced S protein stability. These results highlight the importance of booster vaccine doses for maintaining protection against the Omicron variant, and provide mechanistic insight into the altered functionality of the Omicron spike protein.", "metadata": {"pmid": "34981053", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "mesh_terms": []}}

In this report, we evaluated an alphavirus-based replicating RNA vaccine expressing Spike proteins from the original SARS-CoV-2 Alpha strain and recent VoCs delivered in vivo via a lipid inorganic nanoparticle. Vaccination of both mice and Syrian Golden hamsters showed that vaccination induced potent neutralizing titers against each homologous VoC but reduced neutralization against heterologous challenges. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with homologous SARS-CoV2 variants exhibited complete protection from infection. In addition, vaccinated hamsters challenged with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibited significantly reduced shedding of infectious virus.

The most widely used alternative to ELISA screening is to use an intracellularly expressed GFP reporter construct which allows sorting of recombinant gene expression cells based on GFP fluorescence intensity. The disadvantage of cell sorting, however, is that the resulting population will be polyclonal with the danger of instability and overgrowth of low producers. In addition, GFP or its variants can be toxic to host cells at high concentrations, and thus may reduce growth and robustness of high producer cells or even cause them to become apoptotic. We have developed a new mammalian expression system in which a recombinant protein and a fluorescence protein, AcGFP1, are expressed on the same plasmid separated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). A signal peptide was incorporated upstream of AcGFP1 so that the fluorescent protein is secreted from cells, preventing cellular toxicity from intracellular accumulation and enabling convenient and accurate measurement of the protein. Expression tests of Ebola viral envelope GP1 and HIV gp120 proteins using this expression system in 293-H cells showed recombinant protein expression levels were closely correlated with AcGFP1 yield. Therefore, AcGFP1 can serve as an accurate reporter for recombinant protein expression and measuring AcGFP1 concentration provides a convenient, product independent and universal way for efficient clone screening.", "metadata": {"pmid": "34920134", "journal": "Protein expression and purification", "mesh_terms": []}}

To answer this question, we employed a phage-based deep mutational scanning approach (Phage-DMS) to compare which linear epitopes are targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in humans and macaques following either vaccination or infection. We also used Phage-DMS to determine antibody escape pathways within each epitope, enabling a granular comparison of antibody binding specificities at the locus level. Overall, we identified some common epitope targets in both macaques and humans, including in the fusion peptide (FP) and stem helix-heptad repeat 2 (SH-H) regions. Differences between groups included a response to epitopes in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) in vaccinated humans but not vaccinated macaques, as well as recognition of a CTD epitope and epitopes flanking the FP in convalescent macaques but not convalescent humans. There was also considerable variability in the escape pathways among individuals within each group. Sera from convalescent macaques showed the least variability in escape overall and converged on a common response with vaccinated humans in the SH-H epitope region, suggesting highly similar antibodies were elicited. Collectively, these findings suggest that the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in macaques shares many features with humans, but with substantial differences in the recognition of certain epitopes and considerable individual variability in antibody escape profiles, suggesting a diverse repertoire of antibodies that can respond to major epitopes in both humans and macaques.", "metadata": {"pmid": "34909774", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "mesh_terms": []}}

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from PCR-confirmed, recovered COVID-19 convalescent patients (n=30) infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States collected in April and May 2020 who possessed at least one or more of six different HLA haplotypes were selected for examination of their anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses using a multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer staining approach. This analysis examined if the previously identified viral epitopes targeted by CD8+ T-cells in these individuals (n=52 distinct epitopes) are mutated in the newly described Omicron VOC (n=50 mutations). Within this population, only one low-prevalence epitope from the Spike protein restricted to two HLA alleles and found in 2/30 (7%) individuals contained a single amino acid change associated with the Omicron VOC. These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses should recognize the Omicron VOC, and that SARS-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this time. The newly identified Omicron variant of concern contains more mutations than any of the previous variants described to date. In addition, many of the mutations associated with the Omicron variant are found in areas that are likely bound by neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the first line of immunological defense against COVID-19 may be compromised. However, both natural infection and vaccination develop T-cell based responses, in addition to antibodies. This study examined if the parts of the virus, or epitopes, targeted by the CD8+ T-cell response in thirty individuals who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 were mutated in the Omicron variant. Only one of 52 epitopes identified in this population contained an amino acid that was mutated in Omicron.

Several variants have shown decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine-induced immunity, most notably B.1.351 (Beta), although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. Here, we present the initial evaluation in mice of 2 updated mRNA vaccines designed to target SARS-CoV-2 variants: (1) monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encodes for the spike protein found in B.1.351 and (2) mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351.

Elevated responses, particularly to the &#x3b2;-CoV OC43, were observed in all natural infection cohorts tested and were correlated with the response to SARS-CoV-2. The kinetics of this response and isotypes involved suggest that infection boosts preexisting antibody lineages raised against prior endemic CoV exposure that cross react.

Methods: From November 2020 - January 2021, we collected venous blood from HCWs at selected health facilities in South-Central Uganda and from population-cohort participants who reported specific COVID-19 like symptoms in a prior phone-based survey conducted (between May to August 2020) during the first national lockdown. Pre-lockdown plasma collected (between October 2019 and March 18 th , 2020) from individuals considered high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection was retrieved. Specimens were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using the CoronaChek TM rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG lateral flow test assay. IgM only positive samples were confirmed using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) (Architect AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM) which targets the spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 exposure was defined as either confirmed IgM, both IgM and IgG or sole IgG positivity. Results: The seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs was 21.1% [95%CI: 18.2-24.2]. Of the phone-based survey participants, 11.9% [95%CI: 8.0-16.8] had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Among 636 pre-lockdown plasma specimens, 1.7% [95%CI: 0.9-3.1] were reactive. Conclusions: Findings suggest a high seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs and substantial exposure in persons presenting with specific COVID-19 like symptoms in the general population of South-central Uganda. Based on current limitations in serological test confirmation, it remains unclear whether pre-lockdown seropositivity implies prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Uganda.", "metadata": {"pmid": "34704090", "journal": "Research square", "mesh_terms": []}}

Bioengineering of human organoids and organs-on-chips is one extremely promising avenue of research. These miniature, laboratory-grown organ systems have been broadly used during the ongoing, unprecedented coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to show the many effects of the etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on human organs. In contrast, exposure of most animals either did not result in infection or caused mild clinical signs - not the severe course of the infection suffered by many humans. This article illuminates the opportunities of microphysiological systems (MPS) to study COVID-19 in vitro, with a focus on brain cell infection and its translational rel-evance to COVID-19 effects on the human brain. Neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2 has been reproduced in different types of human brain organoids by 10 groups, consistently showing infection of a small portion of brain cells accompanied by limited viral replication. This mirrors increasingly recognized neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients (evidence of virus infection and brain-specific antibody formation in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid).

We aimed to compare the efficacy of interferon beta-1a in combination with remdesivir compared with remdesivir alone in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial at 63 hospitals across five countries (Japan, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, and the USA). Eligible patients were hospitalised adults (aged &#x2265;18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by a positive RT-PCR test, and who met one of the following criteria suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection: the presence of radiographic infiltrates on imaging, a peripheral oxygen saturation on room air of 94% or less, or requiring supplemental oxygen. Patients were excluded if they had either an alanine aminotransferase or an aspartate aminotransferase concentration more than five times the upper limit of normal; had impaired renal function; were allergic to the study product; were pregnant or breast feeding; were already on mechanical ventilation; or were anticipating discharge from the hospital or transfer to another hospital within 72 h of enrolment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous remdesivir as a 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by a 100 mg maintenance dose administered daily for up to 9 days and up to four doses of either 44 &#x3bc;g interferon beta-1a (interferon beta-1a group plus remdesivir group) or placebo (placebo plus remdesivir group) administered subcutaneously every other day. Randomisation was stratified by study site and disease severity at enrolment. Patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to interferon beta-1a and placebo treatment; remdesivir treatment was given to all patients without masking. The primary outcome was time to recovery, defined as the first day that a patient attained a category 1, 2, or 3 score on the eight-category ordinal scale within 28 days, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomised patients who were classified according to actual clinical severity.

Most clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies target the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), but variants often have multiple mutations in several spike regions. To help predict antibody potency against emerging variants, we evaluated 25 clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies for neutralization activity against 60 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with single or multiple substitutions in several spike domains, including the full set of substitutions in B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma), B.1.429 (epsilon), B.1.526 (iota), A.23.1, and R.1 variants. We found that 14 of 15 single antibodies were vulnerable to at least one RBD substitution, but most combination and polyclonal therapeutic antibodies remained potent. Key substitutions in variants with multiple spike substitutions predicted resistance, but the degree of resistance could be modified in unpredictable ways by other spike substitutions that may reside outside the RBD. These findings highlight the importance of assessing antibody potency in the context of all substitutions in a variant and show that epistatic interactions in spike can modify virus susceptibility to therapeutic antibodies.

To help predict resistance to therapeutic antibodies in emerging variants, we profiled resistance patterns of 25 antibody products in late stages of clinical development against a large panel of variants that include single and multiple substitutions found in the spike protein.

In addition to providing partial protection against pediatric tuberculosis, vaccination with bacille Calmette-Gu&#xe9;rin (BCG) has been reported to confer non-specific resistance to unrelated pulmonary pathogens, a phenomenon attributed to the induction of long-lasting alterations within the myeloid cell compartment. Here we demonstrate that prior intravenous, but not subcutaneous, administration of BCG protects human-ACE2 transgenic mice against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 and results in reduced viral loads in non-transgenic animals infected with an alpha variant. The observed increase in host resistance was associated with reductions in SARS-CoV-2-induced tissue pathology, inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine production that multivariate analysis revealed to be only partially related to diminished viral load. We propose that this protection stems from BCG-induced alterations in the composition and function of the pulmonary cellular compartment that impact the innate response to the virus and the ensuing immunopathology.", "metadata": {"pmid": "34494021", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "mesh_terms": []}}

We sought to evaluate the impact of genetic diagnosis, age, and treatment on antibody response to COVID-19 vaccine and related adverse events in a cohort of patients with IEIs. Plasma was collected from 22 health care worker controls, 81 patients with IEIs, and 2 patients with thymoma; the plasma was collected before immunization, 1 to 6 days before the second dose of mRNA vaccine, and at a median of 30 days after completion of the immunization schedule with either mRNA vaccine or a single dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Janssen vaccine. Anti-spike (anti-S) and anti-nucleocapsid antibody titers were measured by using a luciferase immunoprecipitation systems method. Information on T- and B-cell counts and use of immunosuppressive drugs was extracted from medical records, and information on vaccine-associated adverse events was collected after each dose. Anti-S antibodies were detected in 27 of 46 patients (58.7%) after 1 dose of mRNA vaccine and in 63 of 74 fully immunized patients (85.1%). A&#xa0;lower rate of seroconversion (7 of 11 [63.6%]) was observed in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy. Previous use of rituximab and baseline counts of less than 1000 CD3 + T cells/mL and less than 100 CD19 + B cells/mL were associated with lower anti-S IgG levels. No significant adverse events were reported. Vaccinating patients with IEIs is safe, but immunogenicity is affected by certain therapies and gene defects. These data may guide the counseling of patients with IEIs regarding prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for subsequent boosts.", "metadata": {"pmid": "34492260", "journal": "The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology", "mesh_terms": []}}
